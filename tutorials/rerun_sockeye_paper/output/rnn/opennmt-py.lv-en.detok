New doctors strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are demanding their trade unions to start protests over the new treaty.
The British Committee for Medical Association (LMA) is going to ask the Council to support broader protests in early September.
The JRC believes that ministers have failed to discover doubts about the Treaty.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract proposed by the LMA.
The contract voted for 58% of all members participating in the vote.
A letter published on Thursday evening in Twitter by the JC Council member Elna IT states that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore rejected the contract.
She said: 'In view of this, the JUK vote as a result of the Treaty's offer has been completely rejected and decided to require new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues. "
In response to the government's silence, the JC formally requested a meeting with the MPA Council in order to authorise the creation of a new treaty that will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the NHS history.
After the vote, which rejected the contract conditions proposed by the LM, which was recommended by BMA, the new doctor of LMA's new doctor Dr. Johis Malawana.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he said BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary Dgerem Hant said that the treaty would be concluded with the medical forces of England.
Russia and Turkey: Dalliance?
The Greens, who ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to meet and announce eight months of name and the end of the economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin, on the occasion of the Turkish leader in St Petersburg, had the impression that this partnership is more necessary in Ankara.
However, both of them.
Vladimir Putin looked at the husband and did not cause the warm emotion, even given his usual defeat.
By contrast, the gesture, Erdogan Erdogan, has been called the Putin for his "dear friend," he said.
I felt the number.
He said that relations with Russia will not only improve before pre-crisis levels but will become stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan wins as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm leads to contradictory sense.
However, he said that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The first one that he mentioned in his speech was the blending of Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
At that time Moscow reacted strongly.
Putin accused Ankara that it was inspired by a disgrace in Moscow.
It was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
The renewed confidence will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public position has changed since November.
For several months, television controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
It was suddenly that the Turks were guilty.
The most serious cases were that the Erdogan family itself has made a profit from the illegal trade in illegal oil with the Syrian part of Syria.
He was, of course, denied that.
But the main message of the St Petersburg meeting that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology of President Erdogan.
Russia could take this as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends following the failed coup last month in which they tried to overthrow.
The numerous terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There is also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have created serious losses, in particular the ban on the charterreon, which usually provides a number of millions of Russian tourists every year to Turkey's intake.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
In Russia, too, the outlets of Russia and the charterous companies are making it easier for regular flights to be restored.
They expect leave for leave in the Mediterranean in the season.
This week, the national TV TV is intended to fall in fruit and vegetables prices, as the import of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As I quote the local newspaper Very: "The ists, tomatoes, us."
The visit also had other political motives to Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for its weak response to the coup d'Ã©tat.
There can also be dissatisfaction at all with the long-standing negotiations on accession to the EU and the intervention of Putin, which is willing to use the situation that Turkey alienates from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly received additional points in Ankara's eyes in support of its elected government after a coup attempt.
Look at the fact that Moscow is well aware of it, because it is deeply rooted by the fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this gluxle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present as the analysts, 'marginalised alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite public unity, there are still significant differences between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presented itself as a peace of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose information, the two Presidents announced that they had not discussed this issue at the press conference.
The President of Turkey was determined to avoid the disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight it.
There is no clear consensus, as both countries could find common ground on Syria.
However, months after months, the situation of hostile relations and potential disasters, where NATO's membership of Turkey was shut down by Turkey, has improved the situation, as both leaders have at least reopened negotiations.
Scottish Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SB will have a support role in the future, said the Bank Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, the ICC will no longer be available.
The BBC channel in Scotland was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has refused these ambitions because eight years ago, the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts from the SCB have used the ICC brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the SNI, and at the end of the Vimimdon champion of Vimimdon.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Wales, all references from the ICC, outside the main office office and official exchanges, will be replaced by the name of NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the brands of the Ulster Bank are already used.
It will also be seen as smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Dummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
There was an interviews with customers and staff in Inverse during the journey.
He told BBC Scotland's channel: "The ICC will become our brand brand and work our employees, because we are more than a brand bank."
By time, the bank itself became a global brand and the ICC became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their sector and our workers will work under these brands.
The SKO has already announced that "the sponsors of the S6 Union will not continue and involve various brands of sport.
"It is time to become a brand bank, because we have already asked ourselves how to become a better bank for its clients."
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become an excellent bank for our customers and will develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focus on customer needs, not our own needs, we have obviously made a major difference.
We can revitalise these brands again, so I think it is time now.
The kidnappings are fighting 3000th victory, with the first place in New Academy with a horse Predeecect.
Descratus the corrupts of the cork in the corrupt, shot their 3000th victory twice the first coin.
On Friday, the cabinet of the kidny in the UK has won his 300 victory in the history of the UK, with the first place in New Academy.
He reached this in the second victory of this coin, which took place in his home town, with the Predilecation, which was trained by John Gost.
He has been in the sixth year, who has reached the horses of the horse.
He has joined the Serbian Gordonam Richardus, Dougam Smitis, Lesterer Pigoto, to the Edery and Villius Karson.
"This is something specific," he said.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this has happened in the New mackerel because I live for 30 years.
This is not a great deal, this is not the Karyal Abris, but the ordinary day of Friday, together with 20 000 people.
I feel easy and very grateful.
After the victory, the deors and the Predilection are expected to appraise and trap.
The two fans have reached this record with the hall, the champion of Ripol Jonsons and the career of 20-15, who has been in his career for more than 4.
Lester Pigt, denated the winner, won a "4493 victory."
The kidny is one of the best fans of today and there is no surprise that he has made a success, which only has a real chance to achieve.
He is a fruitful and strong, but his tactics are distinguishing her from other fans.
He is a fantastic spokesman, his enthusiasm and the charter of the charter are attracting fanatics to this form of sport.
A few weeks ago, I said, in the pocomer, that he would have fought for the kidnappings, that he would have fought for 6000 winning, if only the weekend and the big comfortable.
However, it is a real pleasure to be very pleased that, for 30 years, you have regularly won the UK in the United Kingdom.
He is a consensual one, which has a great deal of great value in the British bicycle, and he is an excellent coup.
The Ik Dei noted this achievement with his company's mark - a flight leap.
In the recreational wind up to a flight, the kidnappers have been British horses for twenty years ago.
This has been a complete road.
He has won countless boys, including the famous of the 1996 "Grand Researchers," and survived by an aircraft crash and the discovery of the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was difficult to return after six months' time, but he showed his strength, challenge those who questioned him back in their best form.
And he would be able to take part in the coin for some time - Deas have already said that I would be happy to continue to participate at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismissed the administration of the administration of Sergei Ivanol
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not expected the government of the administration, Sergei Ivanova.
Ivanov has been the nearest people of Putin for many years.
Today, 63 years old politician has been appointed for a special representative on natural and transport matters.
The Kremlin in the Kremlin said that Putin's' decision to release Ivanova from the head of the Head of the Government of Russia ', without mentioning the reasons.
Mr Ivanova, who was a member of his office since 2012.
A diplomat has been a diplomat for 44 years.
It was born in 1972 in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn, a prestigious Moscow international institute of international relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Too embassy.
As reported by the Kremlin's website (Russian), he led the President's Protocol and the government of government staff later.
He said, "Thank you for your confidence."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the State when drawing up laws and controlling your decisions.
Putin told us of the Russian public that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his office and recommended his substitute as his substitute.
Is there any hardship?
This step was confused by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sold and close to Vladimir Putin's allies and, like Putin, worked at the time of Soviet security service, VDK.
He was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
On television, both men announced that Ivanov resigned from his own initiative.
But in spite of the litigation that has been taken, it is rarely such an explanation to persuade it, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight for power?
No one knows this.
However, the official statement that the man who was regarded as a possible president, suddenly wanted to become a leader of the Russian environment policy, is being treated with great scepticism.
In the Kremlin's website, Ivanov, the Kremlin said: 'This is a fact that I would ask you to entrust this difficult office at the beginning of 2012, even to say, problematic posts, four years' time
I have shown that I have worked for this office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in the past.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the National Security Service of KDK, like Putin.
Putin was led by the Federal Security Service at the end of 1990, which is the successor of VDK, Ivanov, who has taken his office.
When Putin came to power he referred to Ivanova, among the five people who trust the most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was considered to be a potential candidate for President of Russia as Putin's election to a third term would be anti-constitutional.
However, at that time, the President became close to Putin's allies - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and, after three and half years, he returned to his office.
The appearance of fish in the Banfa
A man from Banfi is asking for assistance to identify the conditions of the species that have appeared in his dear in Banfia.
Keen Beins think that 75 fish could be sanctioned, who have left water.
Mr Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video boat on the eve of the erects on the eve of the erects of the fish on the eve of the erects.
The interface of the Kwines: the bridge is now connected to Faifs.
At present, 1.35 billion are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers are connected to the northern part of the Kausferian Interface and vibrant, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifs.
The first of the four connected parts is completed, which means that the construction of a bridge is close to the end.
The construction structure of Faife is 600 metres long and weighed 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of direct and 46 support for cables.
At present, 1.35 billion are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Economic Secretary in Keor Brauns has been going to the construction site today and was one of the first who was on the bridge.
He said: 'This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Kwine-fertilian bridge'.
In this project, we see an insurmountable engineering solution where more than 30 000 tonnes of cecement and steel are used in the construction of this part.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, the combination of bridge and vibrant, it is an extremely sensitive process that requires a huge degree of accuracy.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the last stage, which will link the bridge with Rositu, will be put in place today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for the construction.
"The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link shows the construction of higher class engineers.
Following the installation of the last road, and its connecting with the north, we have postponed the northern road to the part of the land or vibrant.
This was done by a vibrant group of 700 milmemeters in the south to the south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, a very sensitive operation.
A great deal, because vibrant is 222 metres long, weighing around 6,000 tonnes, and it had to be spent around 3%.
It was only a few milmmeters, because the lap in both directions worked.
Fortunately, everything was good.
Simone Baille is making a gold exercise for women.
The tensions were dead.
There are concerns.
Simone Baille is not concerned.
Dinamically.
No effort is made in the case of the bee.
It is not a floor.
Full perfect.
And finally the Olympic championship.
On Thursday 19 years old American, a gold meal won the gold meal in a fully displayed between themselves and the rest of the world.
Her common points in 62,198 were a head of the head of the head of the courts than the silver winning of the silver meal and her wife and bronze medals.
On Thursday, US athletes Simn Baille carried out a poisoning sport exercise in the country in the summer of 2016.
Baille became the fourth to be the fourth to the Americans, who won the winning champion and the fifth best exercise, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best of their generation and perhaps the best.
When the final result was announced, she has discarded in the arts because the long way to come to this moment.
This achievement is inconsistent with the insurmountable athletes such as Mayal Felps, who raised their sport at another level.
The Baille has dominated its sport over the last three years, with 15 medals in the world championship, including 10 gold medals, with the following excellent, accurate and ambitious contempt, that the 1984 Olympic championship was called the best.
In Brazil he expected the last test to be a test where she had to try to compete with expectations that were put on him and not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointing if you return to your home in judgment, in the Texin without gold medals.
In the summer of 2016, the US athletes SimÃ³n Baille and Aliup Raismane are flowing on the basis of the current multitude of the gold and silver, in the summer of 2016.
The first gold meal of Baille was won on Tuesday by making a special ranking of ranks in Marta Karolw.
Although Bailsa claims that in his long way, there was nothing expected to wait for the massacre.
Some of her wife on free movement, including her special pivotal transition, are accompanied by Latin American music, which would be a great deal of work in the streets of the Rio Olympic Games.
It is not coincidence.
The issuer, which was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still a infant and was found in the Eimary Bienny's mother, on a trip to sport, where the Burmanes have been held in Burmanes, which had to be taken into account
She has not lost the multimense competition since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Baille wants it.
Although the Mustarefina of two rotation came to a little, it was only a illusion.
The wear bee and free movement - the part of the competition, where Baille will defend his championship, is still before.
She was at the forefront with the result of 15,433 per barrel and strengthened the leadership with 15.933 free movement
They were shot their little while they were waiting for the results, which were only the formality and his discharges, when the dream of the dream that she had been written in his own remark.
The result was a small retaliation of the four years of events when she divided the third place with the Mustarefine, but lost the fight for the bronze meal.
This time, 22 years old, the captain called the Americans as a 'grandmother', raised a strong leadership.
After performance in the free movement, which dispersed doubts about her return, she could have spent on the efforts of the air industry.
Meanwhile, for 19 years old Baille on Twitter, which she published this week, it is already completely different.
In a 6 years old, Mahmoud Brauns, the love of the love of the love of the lots in the Filadelphia.
The police said that a 6 years old was shot in the Filadelphia for 6 years, saying that it is already the second six, who shot the Filadelphia this week.
The grandparents of the child, CBS Filadelphia, confirmed that it was Mahmoud Brauns.
The parents say Brauns was shot several times, including in the circuit, the foot, the hand and the bee, but there were still consciousness when they were on the hospital.
She said that his grandfather DeloCongress is simply a "small body."
I cannot believe that.
It was in a hospital in a critical situation and a number of operations have been affected.
The family informed that he will certainly recover.
He had to start to go to the first class in the local school.
Brass is one of four people who were shot in the city of Jermanta.
Three men have also been shot: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
The Canal CBS Filadelphia report that one of the 29 old men is in a critical situation, but the situation of the other two victims is stable.
The Canary message that the child was found in the front seat of the machinery, with a critical situation of 29 years old.
The other two victims were not in the car and police were investigated if any of them were attacked.
CBS Filadelphia told CBS Filadelphia that a number of kidnappers were in danger of being involved.
There was a weapon of a weapon of a weapon of different weapons.
It seems to have been a long-standing shooting.
A cheque was found in both pedestrians.
"It seems that there have been a number of armed shooting here, who took an active part in shooting," Filadelphia, a police captain of Filadelfia, said.
A number of homes and cars were also affected.
Nobody has yet been detained and has been reported that the police is subject to the records of the monitors.
It was a 6 years old, while she had a 6 years old, while she had his own house in the area of his home.
She is slowly recovery, but the police is still looking for the perpetrators.
Why do we need the Simve, the cuh and Lauria?
I call it for a year of year's Women's Olympic Games.
Firstly, I have been to all the summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three small cars, Simone Bails, the British Duga, and Lauria Hernandeza, who inspire many girls of new origin.
People can be proud that this team is also part of the Aliup Raismane, which is Jews and Medison Kok, which is a Catholic.
Finally, this team is truly representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best vigour is the American American Americans.
One year last year, Simmon-on and on 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, on the occasion of a surprise, the Olympic championship became a surprise to the Olympic championship, and America was in a position.
Now the world has seen the incredible exercise of the triple world championship Simn Baille, Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza, with unprecedented, but metharical exercise.
On Thursday, Thursday, Thursday became the fourth to the Americans in a row, which has won gold medals in individual multiplier women.
Her teams won the silver meal of the silver.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different.
Simmons, and Lay and Lauria, came into the Olympic room as the Aliaker and Medisan.
Her is the Olympic Academy, because the next Olympic vinvigation team will only be four athletes, and this is the final year in Marta Karola for the third year.
In fact, the exercise is expensive sport; Vinverers are mainly trained in private light clubs, and they are living by parents who pay training, premises, travel, formations, hotels (coaches, athletes, athletes) and other expenditure.
The vast majority of these light clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, the athletes will run all their training, and this is expensive and a long way to make a contribution to an open family.
Simone Baildeu, a member of the Eimija Buri and Megia Hainia, has been training his athletes since the two girls started to work with a clash.
We must ensure that young girls who inspire Simone, the cheese and Lauria, are cheaper and cheaper.
I set up my own light organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is in Barlelel, and we offer more than 15 000 cities of cities (mainly black and Spanish), free of charge, or a low price; we are also training national and international championships.
In September, we will find a branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide local young people with the opportunity to find out this excellent form of sport.
Wholesale is developing forces, lots and body coordination, as well as taught hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in a small way and that is fantastic.
This type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simmenon, Aliar, the United Kingdom and Medison on the excellent demonstration of the Meving Armed Forces of the Olympic Games and motivation of countless new girls from different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
The new doctors are planning to step up more strikes after the offer of Dgereum Hanta.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Her announced plans to conclude a contract, stating that NHS is in a unstable situation and further delays would only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new treaty for changes to the conditions for working night changes and weekends to improve working conditions in non-standard hours.
Dr. Elna Mcourta, a new doctor in BMA, announced that new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks until the first group of new doctors sign the new treaty, there is a need to make progress, because the time has not been left.
The efforts made by the BPA to resolve the problem of negotiations have faced government unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened in spite of the fact that, last month, the JHP has said that his doors are always open.
Mr PÃ¶ttering has to act immediately, stop inaction and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not do this, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike in April, more than 13 000 utals were postponed and 100 000 visits were visits, while the mother and advisers were trying to replace the treatment that had gone to the pip.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association.
The BPA wants an increase of 54 000 new doctors, subject to new contracts, at the weekend.
Mr DHS, Executive Director of NHS's employment, called for new doctors to go to strike.
Mr Mortimera makes it clear that strikes do not solve anything, but it is only up to us to put pressure on the pressure on those who are burdened and worry, there are stress and delays for patients, carers and their
We have spoken over the last two months with the new doctor to the Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about the ers and the rapporteurs.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as the deployment of staff, flexible training, additional training for those who return after their career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leave of studies and gender pay inequalities in February and May, according to the report.
The risk of 2 potals can be reduced on a daily basis.
Thousands of patients who had their hearts could be treated with medicines on the day of the day, because the official representatives of the official comment to use them more people and a longer period.
Consistency medicines Ticagrelor reduce the risk of the crucialisation of human beings.
These medicines are already being written for 12 months after the concise, by reducing the risk of the distraction.
Nobody represented in NICE to use this preparations for 4 years after the hearts to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems for people with cardiovascular problems.
However, at the moment NNICE's recommendation to use this preparation for 4 years after the hearts in order to further reduce cardiovascular risks.
Every year, some 140 000 people in England are in the heart of the hearts and the quarter of them are going through a return or an insult.
The accumulation of fat in heart is caused by the accumulation of fat and the insult.
If the sentiment is burdened, it may cause thrombes, blocking blood flow on heart and giving rise to hearts.
However, if thrombs are discovered from the blood of blood, it can go to the blood of blood and block blood access to the brain, leading to infant.
The people who have had the heart of the hearts are exposed to a greater risk of the heart of the heart.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed by Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombing.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, comment on people to use 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months and 3 years up to 60. twice a day, together with the spin.
Professor Kerola Longson, Director of the NICE health technology, said "Despite the fact that there is access to medicines, more than a quarter of people who have had their hearts are going through another hearts or insult who often have serious consequences."
The fear of repeated hearts may have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor combined with the aspirin is effectively reducing the risk of distraction and inflict risk for people who have already experienced it.
As a result of the treatment of treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities for thousands of people who are thus winners.
Given the limited information on Ticiagrelor efficiency and security, in particular the risk of bloody blood use for more than three years, the draft guidelines will not comment on this period longer than that date.
culture of ititcorrectness contributes to fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former mayor mayor of the city, Lutfurs Rahman, was dismissed from corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness has led to a eyes to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Aikes criticises the police, the election monitors and the city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process, as "fear of the ethnic and religious interests" is afraid.
The former Secretary of State, who has now become a leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of the voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards to the electoral stations in order to protect intimidation.
He also recommends that the voters should show a identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, the voters should only be given the word and address.
He even recommends that the voters' votes in favour of voters be mark by special means to prevent double voting.
They also need greater protection, says Sir.
He considers that the press should provide greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent fraud, but also to protect local authorities from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it'.
The report was commissioned by Dauningstris after the scandal in connection with the elections to the Cushamled city.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to remove the city of Lutfures Rahman from the city of the city and the illegal activities of the city.
The Court found that Rahman "cynical missed the religious view of its Muslim communities and silence their critics, accused of racist and motherhood.
"The Rahman has led my election campaign with a view that religious religious responsibility is to vote for him."
Around 300 votes were counterfeit or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Erse also points out signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud was particularly worrying in the form of a mail by a mail in which the oldest members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for the candidates.
Sir years suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documents to identify the identity of the person.
His report says: "Evidence shows that members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the oldest candidates of communities, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan."

CBC's Olympic Games apologise for his comment that the Chinese's grey is' end as pig '.
The analysis of the two years old Ai Yanis finies, Bairona Macdonala, is at 4x200 m in the fourth quarter of Ai Yanis in the fourth place of the CBC.
Canadian Canal CBC had been forced to apologise because one of the comments made on this comment was that 14 years old Chinese grey from the competitions was "flight from the rival" and "end" as a pity.
Mr Bairons said his microphone had been excluded when she had been excluded from his personal point of view.
The surge that was included in the CBC team's team in order to give comments to life, said: "It is a little for the small fourteenth year from China."
"We'll have fed out," she said.
Thank you very much.
The result of 14 years old of the KICs, Ai Yanhana, was 1: 57.79 secondment, which is the result of 1.61 seconds less slowly than the result of the cabinet Rucks, allowing the
The audience across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because it was shocked to hear the tone and the language.
Emets in the Emelaine wrote on Twitter: "Is it a direct CBC who has just said that 14 years of the year of China" ended as pig "?
Idiots did not understand that they were still in the direct etery.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free stistila women were called "small teenagers from China, who do not hold".
Criticism against Bairons was quickly adopted as many requests for explanations.
Twitter did not believe that the users could believe to hear Bairona Macdonalda comments.
Twitter
Ten representative CBC and Canada and you are all sounds like a racist.
In the aftermath of Scotland, then, at the time he led CBC live, I apologise for the comments of the Macdone, saying: 'We apologise that a comment on grey results was the direct etery'.
It was a failure of the choice of words and we regret that it was.
CBC apologised more than 90 people who had reacted on Twitter.
I had to apologise to my colleague, Scotland, in his place.
Then CBC opted for an apology for more than 90 Twitter users complaining about the Macdonation comment.
The channels were also quickly published by the channels and the statement.
We very much regret the fact that the comments were made and they came to the direct economist.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologised to all the live viewers and to the people in social media.
For the sake of clarity, the comments made by Bairona were made about the grey rather than addressed to her personally.
However, they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessful, and the Bairons are very regrettable.
On Thursday afternoon, a person personally apologised for the direct etereness and tried to explain that he did not think he would be treated as a personal attack.
He said that "I would like to take a moment and apologise for a comment that I said yesterday after the free competition of women."
I am talking about a grey, not for him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to pay tribute and I really regret it.
Prince is shocked by a woman who is not shameful among the subcontractors.
It was uncomfortable when a woman started to get out of it in order to have a bicycle in the station.
The situation is even further exacerbated by his time in order to make sure that they stand up and then discovered them by putting a bick back on the shelves.
She continued to look at the clothing Iouverie Place in the market in Bouverie Place and the four four bicks.
PrÃ©k's als Bouverie Place Trade at the centre of the trading centre, the place where this woman had a subcontract and then put it back on the ground.
At that time, two children in the shop were also the mother of Jenvidsone, who told us that "a woman who is not known in a subcontract of a subcontractor and left his feet and left the shops," nothing said.
She said that people were unable to believe their eyes.
It was a good hole, she has taken a thoughts on a thrives, disguised its bicks and bicycles and bicked on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where they had to measure them, she was simply going on the ground.
Everyone looked at the bicycle and obviously the woman did not like it because she simply put them back on the shelves.
She said three more bicks, until she had not like any of them and left the shops.
It was not the case that they would worry that someone is looking at or advice about the people who bought their bee, which she is going to give.
Dear on Kenya: "The idea that someone bought a bee, which has been unwasted by another person and then not wasted."
The accident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
"I accept that," I said, "I assume that the workshops were out of her bee from a supermarket shelf, which is acceptable."
I cannot imagine it could buy new subtitles and find out that another woman has had a time of time and then not wasted.
Primk said that the Prince is known about the incident held on Tuesday 9 August.
The specific drama has been removed from the arts.
How to protect ourselves from firearms through the use of
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect themselves in the near districts from the attachment of a firearm, we were talking with Mr Kizv Maga from New York.
Whether you attack from the front or on the side, this video can be seen as to protect and prevail over the attachment.
The minds indicate if the attachment attack on the back, then first we need to go back to see the attachment of the attachment and to avoid one trajectory.
Then the weapon must be opened between its front hand and shoulder and make the sun in the face with his free elcont.
Then then I'll have a shot with the shot and the attachment of the attachment to the attachment of the attachment, to withdraw him, to take it down, to go down with the weapon with the weapon
If an attachment is coming out of the front, the situation is similar: it must be avoided that there is no trajectory, a weapon of a weapon, and it must be displayed in such a way that the
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and the opponents of a cork must, and finally, take the weapon of him and go back to a further image of him.
How is it difficult?
There is a video to see how it is doing exactly that.
However, let us remember if you are not in the trov Maga meisting, then it is safer to give the love of its money.

The family of the people of Vandinals has been left out of the residence of a neighbouring terror, causing damage to the 50 000 pounds of social life.

In this case, a number of factors should be assessed, since in the future this property is not good enough.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
There were three sons over the past that have periodically been held by the police and the police say that their terror has expressed violence, insurgents on the streets with beisball, intimidation of the local population, the use of drugs, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs, and the

The Hosovole Housing Service was forced to take them forcibly when they had 11 weeks to get out of their homes on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbouring neighbours were very happy to make their lives because their life was absolute.
One said: 'They did not care for others'.
We lived them with them 20 years ago, this has always been the case.
It is unbelievable as often we have seen the police.
I could not get it this morning.
We stand up because there was so silence here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally leaving, there will be wonderful here.
The Fitzpatrus, who is the head of the neighbourhood of Cork's neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here 20 years and the police was regularly held here.
There were various old and unspent objects in the field of home August.
He also said: 'It is a pity that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because exerting their homes is always the last step to be congratulated by the Housing Service. "
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and neighbours have been very hard to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work put in this case by all my team, the police of Devon and Cornvolas and members of the compassioners who were courageous and cooperate with us, providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will facilitate neighbouring life and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrus said that all three sons have lived in different periods, but everyone was around 20 years old.
The net hair left to the floor in one of the room after being made.
Professional staff will now have to meet the waste cabin left in the home.

Many of the homes were set in the gragraphs.
The police message that they will continue to put the renters who violate their renters.
As a police representative of the Devon and Cornvoli police, Andijel said that this exertion is a clear warning to other Irish tenants who continue to breach the rules.

The police of Devon and Kronvola is not acceptable to criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.

The President who remained in the building: 145, 145.
On Friday, 12 August marks 145 years since the birth of the second Latvian President Gustav.
The first Latvian President of Latvia's first president of Latvia's first president of Latvia's first president of Latvia's first president of Latvia's first President Chakor has been widely described in the country.
No one of our statesmen defended democracy and the rule of law so much as a coup, a decade ago, in a book issued by the Gustavus Lhavan in a book in Arnola.
Delfi's Academy, who said, is one of the rare politicians in the world.
The others are always very right.
He taught this at all, nowadays it could be like Raimonds VVeis.
"He was a close to the people," he said.
Today's politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to the KICs as a good leader, but rarely know how not enough he was.
At the time of the government, the only person he has not been denied was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind of kind and smarded, he was hysterical.
"It's a pity with his humour and a democratic sense," he said.
The Faculty of Faculty of History and Faculty of Faculty of the University of Latvia University Aivars Strang, with the "Delfi," agrees with the Academy of
He also noted that the gallery has taken place with respect for minorities, calling on the Jewish representatives to be in the presidential elections.
"It was not a normal action at the time, after the final Presidency, the country has taken this tradition," he said.
He was a silent and balanced man who had long had to become President.
He did not want to, but simply not the trawl.
He was also quite critical of it because he did not know the French language but considered that he would certainly be able to understand it.
"During the Presidency, the French language was taught," said Strang.
The gallery was not in a position to be able to speak again, he did not really like it.
In all circumstances, he is a very good person in Latvia's history, just before he was coming out of the presidential office, he was very demanding.
He was also led to the famous wall in the streets of the famous wall in the streets of 3, where a member of the attraction and crackdown on the rebel was in practice in the government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
It was not a great man of Ulmaa, but the public did not.
"Private negotiations have sometimes said, sometimes, that the actions of the Ulmamam are not being carried out by a little," he said.
There is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption in a peaceful life.
What is the end of today?
It is a pity, but a great part of him is associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, views were centrally.
"She did not have any major turbulence, namely he could be associated with a real stable Presidency," the Strang said.

simple ways to help the child cope with the susceptible of anger.
I often have to deal with the emergence of the child's dusband, the appearance of a ninet parents as something wrong and a disgrace.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" points out the psychological Jekatin Kesa.
The rapporteur urges a small talks on these natural and human points - anger and nnicneus that are periodically affected by each.
Agreed - it is already physical activity addressed to other people, and it usually appears when it comes to angry.
When we adults are angry, alarmed - usually we know who is happening with us and how to deal with it.
We can see our anger and nnicny: to make, suppress, hide, to keep it down, to tell our friends or other relatives, we can keep the angry, to use the cigarettes and to do other things that do not normally do so.
We do not neglect our aggression against others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are looking for anger, do not understand what is happening with them as they name and how they can live.
They can say 'j', "you're foolred," Slicta mamma, "I see you," I said with you, "I said.
Children live in a vicious sense, they are in full place in here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and indeed their feel, and often there are different emotions.
It is very important that parents are not forbidden to feel feel, including anger, shame about it and not to do so, but on the contrary, to help the child.
What is the relationship?
A long day working day in which everything has not worked as you would like, or simply a bad mood - is so many reasons why I would like to take a moment, a day or even longer, from all over the world.
Can we also see relations at a time and a little poorly?
Does it, however, show that each of its partners can go on?
I share my opinion in various ages.
Jen (23) is short and concise: "I think that if you are in relations, you are not with the real people."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has found a scheme which, perhaps, can help anyone.
If you feel that a partner is starting to fall down on the smallest detail of every small detail, it is certainly the time when we should look into other hunting fields to see whether you are missing or, in particular, they do not think that they are not thinking or even unwilling to see them.
So the answer is: yes, the holding can help save time and understand how important you are for you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, relations must be held on one of the other day of each day because, if the time spent with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the disputes are inevitable.
This is due to the fact that I am going to see me every detail, which the other is doing, and it is beginning to fall.
People are starting to take one another, especially if even there is no longer to talk about what you have done on the day.
My personal experience makes it think, so I have not taken the relationship more than a couple of months.
If you think about the fact that elsewhere or else it is better, why is this woman who, together, deserves one who can think about that there is not enough good and beyond the mountains?
There is already a small amount of money.
If there is no, there is no.
"I have, therefore, a little punishing those who do not have '.
The doctor (33) is a completely opposite view.
It seems to me that everyone needs a moment for me.
You could see each moment, all the time from the morning to the evening to the other in the eyes of each other and blow the love love.
Real3!
There are so many things - friends, work, balls.
Everything has their time.
Of course, in friendship or wife, if both they are aware of their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can survive up to the caps.
It and only so.
MarÅ¡ (27) said: "It is hard to say - need or not need, may or must not be taken, but one thing is clear, but it is clear that it does not exist in relations with us."
If this issue is raised, it should be borne in mind that there will be any change in the near future, for good or bad half, depending on itself.
I think that while we are a new and a clash, it is up to the need - for all the time, but when everything remains serious and relations are in a very different phase, then the rest cannot be a question.
You do not decide to spend all life together!
"If you cannot withstand one other society, and every time we need a scrap, then when you are going to be pensioners, who comment on how the garden cds or the dispute about where the cost of the day is to be used better.
All the words have changed.
With his enthusiasm and enthusiasm personal personality, Rozena, first of all, was made up of the interest of the Latin American people in theory arts.

In addition to the extincts of the Abul Ghone and Callel museum, the Charlemagne and music museum, the paedy mmuseum, Tukle museum and several private components in Latvia

German researchers discussed the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities in communist miles in former eastern Germany could be much higher than it was considered before, but doubts about the real number of victims are still not discovered.
According to the data, on Wednesday, the Berlin Wall's museum, Checkpoint Charlie, was killed at the border with the Western allies of the Western allies of 1945 to 1981989, and the subsequent wounded of 1841 people who have tried to get out of their territory.
The Museum with border deaths has been studied for years and the number of victims has been corrected every time.
This year, 11 deaths are added to the list, including a six years old boys, who drowned, trying to reach the family in West Germany through the then Czechoslot and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall, the Soviet army is also the Soviet army.
"The damage caused by a double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," he said.
"Our task is to ensure that the wall of persons who died in trying to escape a country controlled by the communist state would be maintenance and disappeared," said Himdeer.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure 1841 is unconvincing," SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung said in an interview, an expert from the German Democratic University of Eastern Germany to be held in Berlin.
He, together with other researchers in the Berlin Free Film, currently review possible suspicious deaths at the border, and has so far managed to approve only 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by the communists of Berlin.
In view of the people who died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to get into the West through neighbouring countries, the number of victims, after Shota, could reach around a thousand.
However, it is far less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodology.
Checkpoint is also the suicide cases of the suicide border guards of East Germany, regardless of whether they were directly linked to their services.
The death penalty is also the result of the death penalty.
"If Senaners aged between 70 and 80 years after the border controls died from the heart of the hearts," the consequences of the murderous border, "Hillary said.
However, it is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people, who may probably have died as a result of the treatment experienced by their experience, and those who have caused the death of a long-standing waiting in the hot at the border
The list of victims is not easy, as the communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and the researchers must be given documents in different archives, points to the hate.
However, the Headquarters Group recently relaunched new documents and, therefore, it could make a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.

At the request of the Federation, Uvi was in favour of helping her.
Anyone who himself is a member of the Executive Committee of the LOK, strongly criticised the activities of the LOC, led to the use of blame for the Olympic sport.

"This was an emotional week, but it means a great deal for me."
This only confirms how much it means us and how much I have worked, Heles and Robin.
The 3 years led by the Hele and Robin have been excellent.
Without this, we would not have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better training member or a better training.
Hele Levere and Hetere Stanvee have not lost the single scrapping over five years.
There is a long way to reach so much speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, where teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to come closer, Staninge and Saveres were too big.
We felt every moment.
Hele denied: "The rolling stock is maintained."
It is really important to lose the focus.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we did not have the intention to overthrow record record, but simply it is a good thing to do and win the cold.
A few years will rest in order to decide what to do.
The next month will be the center and the television search for Stan Bashshall.
She simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed around six months to understand that I am the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it needed around four minutes.

In Spain, the potential for reducing the deficit is a threat to the failure to create government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficiently enough measures to reduce the deficit rate of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to the euro area.
The estimates show that, despite austerity measures, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4. 4% of GDP, and in Spain 5. 1%.
The European Commission decided, however, not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the next time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against both countries is growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative.
Critics also point out that EC decisions are not consistent in their decisions, from the start of agreement on common rules and then unable to apply them in their lives.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jenss Vemanmanna, said that Europe would lose its credibility in creating a citizens' vision that European rules are recommendations rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit until the end of this year Portugal and Spain until 2018.
The European Commission promise to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal have to be prepared to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances are required.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's objective could be achieved at the specified time and this year budget deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional focus on the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year budget deficit must be reduced to 4. 6% next year, to 3. 1% next year and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, in the next two years consolidation measures should be 0. 5% of GDP every year.
In particular, the fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months is particularly difficult, and it is becoming increasingly possible that Spain may have a third parliamentary elections during a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political picture of the third elections in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party remains the party's party for the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, who will again gain a few 33% of votes.
The Socialists has been a little more popular than the socialists, while the 'Podemos', or 'Together', can 'and' Ciudananos', or 'Citizens' popularity.
The People's Party wants the socialist and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government for this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and present to the European Commission for approval by mid-October 2017.
Mr Rafael Hernando, the representative of the People's Party Parliamentary Assembly, said, if the government is not going to be able to fail and parliamentary elections will be held for third time, Spain will become a ridiculous ridiculous
The purity of magazines in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
Fifth years after the beaches of beaches, activists concluded that the number of waste found every year is increasing, and most of the bathing visitors are concerned.
The polluted bathing sites are directly in Riga.
The thoughts of the Capital of Thought are clear that bathing sites are fed on a daily basis, but the fight against clean visitors is very difficult.
In addition, drought-left waste can be brought into water during rainfall in water, so that its quality is significantly damaged.
Except in the case of papage beaches and certain places in Kurdish, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a communication has been distributed this week by the volunteers of the 'My sea' campaign.
The fifth year on the road along the way of Riga's seamen, activists concluded that the number of waste left to the population has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately this year, this is a critical assessment.
"We can see that this will be a year when the number of waste on beaches 100 metres, perhaps even more than 200 units," says Jalis Ulme, a representative of my sea.
Latvian Radio call, he was an immediate beaches, where volunteers continue to move along the Riga Gulf.
This year, between the various municipal waste and picks, activists have had to collect even the slight light light bulbs left in the sea.
The participant, the organiser, and the organiser, Ulme teic, are directly responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beaches of the beaches, the more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, different waste from the mixture, plastic parks, which are already in the process of depletion, no longer can be identified, and smoke, fans, fans, fans, fans.
There are bathing sites between the cleanest beaches.
For example, almost 800 metres of waste units are collected on average every hundred metres per hundred metres.
The organisers of the campaign also make it clear that you also have a smoke and a warning or a ban on warning every day.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites together - Daugavgrles, Yemenbul and Academy - unfortunately meet large and far more than the desired or target, the target to which Latvia is moving until the end of 2020.
Bathing cleaning in Riga is taking place on a daily basis, even twice in the summer of the summer, a representative of the domicile UUis Aquare.
However, the fight against clean visitors is very difficult.
We are going back to this issue of culture.
"Those who are slight, use alcohol, smoke and make all the things that must not, even special signs, do not work," said auction.
Therefore, the audience calls on the bathing visitors to report on polluters also to the police.
The police can be called the police safely to indicate these violations and, in this way, to fight.
Perhaps some new warnings may be imposed, but, as I said, it is hardly a radical change.
"As all together we simply need to turn and be tolerated against such offenders," he said.
In the meantime, the water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, just like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has been good for all, and there is no limit of bathing.
"Last time we will take an analysis at the end of August," said Normunds, the oldest Senate for the Environment.
In the course of strong rainfall, land-based waste can be fed into water.
In turn, this may affect the quality of the environment.
The Russian elite Russian elite continues - the change of the head of Putin's administration.
What has been left?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would leave his office and will continue to be the President's special representative on the natural, ecological and transport issues.
By reporting the changes, Putin was given the words of Ivanovich to the television ambassadors: 'Dear Sergej Borisov, we are working together with you for many years and we are doing this successfully.'
I am pleased to see how you are in your duties to you.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
I therefore understand your desire to change the rural activity.
And I hope that you will also take full advantage of your knowledge and experience in the new post.
However, it is highlighted that the administration of the presidential administration is a very important position and made Ivanova one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections to the Duma next month were expected to be expected in Russia, there were rumours that this step was linked to the fight for power in Russia's political elite.
Ivansov was also called the alleged replacement of Putin's office, so the statement that he wanted to take the position of the President of the President on the issue of natural protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to Lsm.en archives, Ivanov is the General Colonel of KDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sold and close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He was launched in 191975 with Putin.
He was later head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the first Russian President, Boris Yeltina was appointed as Secretary of State of Russia.
In 2000, the Information Security doctrine was approved by Mr Ivanova, which, including Russia, provided for the revitalisation of national censorship mechanisms.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became a Russian defence minister, but in 2005, the President of the Prime Minister Mikhail Four was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the President of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also remain a place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
It comes from the elite of the family Soviet Party.
The head of the President of the President, Vaino, has been appointed by Ivanov itself.
We have long known with Antonis Eduardovich.
Then, when you worked in the government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we are in practice every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, after all professional and personal characteristics, he is prepared for this work," Ivanov said.
It comes from a family who belong to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather has taken a senior position in the Estonian Communist Party, including the ten years up to 1988-1988.
In the end of the year, the European Parliament's President Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering said: "It is not the case that the European Parliament has asked Moscow to be allowed to use force against demonstrators.
However, he received a refusal and lost his office shortly.
In short, the Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antonis Vaino is a Moscow International Relations Institute and managed by the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President of the President.
As reported, the last unstable Russia has shaken the removal of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of the Governor of several areas and federal representatives.
President Vladimir Putin is reacting by President Vladimir Putin before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing number of power structures in force.
The udy is also losing the Olympic Games in Niziforenko.
This was a battle in the first round, and the Latvian gluudt in Latvia has concluded its participation in the Olympic Games.
Trener Oleg Oleg, Latvian Television for Television said, that the hope was very little and it was clear before the competition.
He also found that he had won the trace in the fight.
It is very important that in order to be able to go to the Olympic Games, in the case of Niziforenko, there were another weight in the same category than in the weight category to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan was the target of 25 kilograms.
As reported, Jevgey Borodavko's weight category to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki went to two and a half minutes until the opponents were in a clean victory.
The report was adopted with 516 votes in favour, 16 against and 24 abstentions.
Rio LTLs disappear.
The day was launched by a dium Jerodavko Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more prevalent opponents, but it is sometimes surprising at times.
He did not.
It was even more difficult for us to do so, as the experience of smaller and opponents was even more complex.
The result is similar, even though he went down to a minute and a minute for more than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of ambition in Latvia in recent times.
In the past, at the federation of the federations, at the federation of the federations, there is no more than one year after the Federation's management and his financial leisure Vladimir Cold, the Latvia's first country, said.
The keys who are counting on Kazakhstan's jail and Vsevolde Zoony do not see the heirs.
But if not, there will be no.
And it is the prerogatives of the federations.
This is why, as from other finalists, Rza panoric was the promise of the President of the Rio Federation to fight medals.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening, Samohas / Pee Solberberg, the Evane / Pee Solbere, were waiting for an intolerance and concern.
Intright as a "death" group, losers of the game.
The Latvian duplicate was a small derogation, but it could also be lost, but no more than four points in two.
The tense was still up to the previous game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling was above the wall.
The slight wind of the players created additional difficulties.
At the beginning, it seemed to be our own - that is more comprehensive - allies.
But not.
Latvia was too simple to play here.
It's so much Samotrava and waiting for him to go in.
Canada came down against Cuba at the end of the first sixth and the third at the beginning, because the load was not a joke.
The nice was at the time, because the work was not enough, but when it was a fair job.
Los Samoliv was able to win two six sixth, as the first took over the leadership with 16: 15, but 16 were also left out of the limit.
But the 0: 2 could also be lost because the second six deficits were -4, but also thanks to a winning win.
The third has already gone to Evane.
There was a smoke - it was unconvincing the serve, the second game is often too close to the network and Samoo-vam remained very little in a fruitful attack.
If there was a alien Samotrav in the area of the beans, then he was more successful then, and only the loss would be unprofessional.
The Kremlin was wrong, too, and it is symbolic that the last bomb of the bomb took place directly.
It is a team.
This time it was certainly not a success - the third six of the Evane attacks were in almost a cork from corrupt, but the bomb was still affected by the line.
Two eisi was in the line.
The controversial episodi is also a video of the opponents.
If, in the first two games, Evane was wiped out of the cane, we were very productive.
All together, a total of the tobacco was lost.
The causes of failure must now be analysed calm.
Perhaps it should have been as many as many to live in a way that is not together with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It was two and a half hours.
Perhaps a little self-confidence gave seven semi-fed.
Perhaps the pocfurt did not have to play it but to come here more quickly and to be more activist.
Perhaps it was a mistake to find an area of sport.
So far more than answers.
Our bishers end up.
Short on medals.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup were still left and Master Master.
There has never been friends and will not be friends, and there will be too different personalities.
But it is not necessary.
When a dream of the Olympic medals has gone down, the idea of divorce may also arise because the fault of the fault will not only be sought in the face but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it is much more difficult in Latvia to find a worthy partner.
The two brothers play a blow, but Jesis with Toma has already tried, and also the self-shot, while Mikhail Samoliv is still too green to start the world's world.
It is not better than this option that it will be better than that of the World Cup.
They did not burn the side of the side.
And everything.
Of course, we also need to take into account the fact that beaches are more popular, new across borders, and only the real growth is less than two metres.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Today's longer stay.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to live in the places offered by the games and to choose their own.
The United States is living on a cruise ship, part of the Olympic village.
Also, part of the beaches of beaches have been found in the hotel cohotel.
This time, a great exaggerated price was required for journalists from journalists to a total night.
Therefore, the choice has also fallen to the Irish.
The risk is because sometimes they may be inconvenient from logistics.
This time the risk is justified.

After a period of 10 years' Porgy and Haa ', the Capaja.
In 1973, the Latvian National Operation Porgy (Porgy and Haire) has been in Latvia.
Since then, the internationally recognised dog has not been brought again.
This is why the organisers of the Cirus festival festival, and the organisers of the Capaja Army Forum, have decided to give the audience the opportunity to benefit from the George Gera.
"We have a great pleasure that after a decade, when the last time in the Capaja, the operation of the operation in the Porgand, Porgy and Haa, is to be found to us in a new, new open confeat."
Porgy and Haa have a long musical story of love of love, they are induce, passion and living tragedies and ordinary day-to-day ideas.
It reflects the America-American vitality, music and rolling.
It is this lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so live.
"And yes, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and, in some way, deep," he said.
What I like the most - listening to or through this operation is always the points - the famous daughter, the famous motives, but this transition from one nature to another, in light of one person or another.
"This is the most exciting, the construction of this building," the operation of the operation of Porgy and Haa, and the dirty, Andris Poga.
The visitors agree that this is an ambitious event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear this famous operation in the world.
It is soundly that it can be the world's elite.
"Enforcement professional", the operation of the operation shall be assessed by the visitor Edgars Lcan.
It was the first time that the "big engine" was played by orchestra and the first time in an operation in the open consortium in the open group of consortium.
Farmers would be able to name the restored buildings on behalf of the restored buildings.
Rzente, a German comforter, said that "the museum of the museum's address in the future could not be a pumzle in the future."
Muzeta's director, Ma La, said that the reregistration of the address would lead to a long bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea was welcomed and therefore agreed to the local authorities.
The city of Riga has put in place a form of basic actuals in this idea in 1956, setting up the Burcarda Dzen monmona Janim Rozenon, who is at a museum.
In the then museum Director, Mr Vilhelme was one of the originators for building this mony.
This could be a purely logical activity in this way.
I am a little shaken for the whole time, but in the Vilhell line, where we will put his name!
"But if you're going to try to think, America" said it said.

We told us last December that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission that accept the decision itself that Brussels does not take a decision.
At the moment, we see that another debate is emerging once again, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council will undoubtedly guarantee that this process will be launched and completed in time," he said.
It was already reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the Culture CEF, a member of the GEF Culture, held a joint relaunch before the next building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of buildings was still not started and collective continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
The Riga City Council's SEF strategy for the renovation of Culture Centres is divided into seemingly independent works of independent rebuilding works, where everyone will provide each other with a different performance.
First: Increasing the availability of GEF Culture Centres and the construction of the surrounding area.
It provides for roundness and engineering, as well as rebuilding buildings.
Second: improving the supply of the GEF Culture Centres.
It plans the interface of buildings, walls and debt restaurants, stage and sound record, as well as to put a building on internal engineering.
Third: improving the collective working conditions of Creative amateur, which includes plans to improve workshops, space heating and ventilation systems.

In 1970, a tragic meeting was held when Juris Paytol took the rally in the Church and Metalla culture was founded by a group calling for an Ingrid G1, Andri Kruman and Jallies.
Over the years, the composition of the group is not only once.
The participants have joined, others have made their way, some have returned.

I wrote a hostile service in the last day.
Last year, I focused on the 'Laudato si' 'Laudato si' and updated the total home, the Earth's theme in Latvia.
This year, of course, I watched what is happening in the world and try to respond to it.
My approach is to coincide with the church recommended that the message of the Spurgea is to be put at the centre of life.
It has to be shown that the people of Spain are responsible for the most painful problems of human life and give him an inspiration to the road.
Then it will address people.
But, in the case of the Chechs, you said 'return to a full people'.
What do you understand with this?
Does this mean that a person is being prevented from the message of church?
And do the church have such a return resource today?

In response to his candidacy on the post of Director General of the National Revenue Service (VD), Inga Kolegova, Head of the National Environment Service, has saved the government from the fall of the University of Social Science of Latvia's University of
The clear explanation of the withdrawal of candidates in connection with the conflict in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the government's criticism.

St children and elderly - young children's taskes.
In this summer season, Riga's self-government has been set up even two new playgrounds in the city, the Cologne and the Churure, which are already available for children.
A wide, multifunctional tag vessel has been installed by the coaches, with various inhalation elements, bridges, games, hubs and coaches.
It is the children of all ages.
There are also cells and different balancing elements.
The world of Fantzia for small boats is in a position to see the parking of the wreck on the Daugava coast of the passenger's port and the cruise cruise ships.
The roof of the roof between Chururcale 4 and 5 of the matches, the blank travels, the balance of the balance, the cells, the taskes and the other elements of games, as well as the remnants of the seamen, the covert, etc.
It is the yardstick in the rubber coverage of the different colour.
Up to the playgrounds from the street, a new, colour-paved coverage was fitted.
A reconstructed road sections are found in the media.
For the Transport Minister, Mr Uldis Augulis, the Latvian National roads (LVC), as well as Binders "Binders," and local representatives of the local authorities today launched the "Russian border" border (Grebbov).
The road is a country's visit card, especially the border routes, so I am particularly pleased to discover the reconstruction phase on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the main roads of the country is improving.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for this programming period will already be spent in 2018, and we need to think about continuing to maintain the most burdened roads for very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all the regions of Latvia without the European Union's funding without the European Union funding
The Minister for Transport also pointed out that proposals made by traffic experts on sustainable funding for Latvian roads will be presented in government during the summer.
In the period between the media and the Lithuanian border, the SIA Binders was launched last year and continued this year after technological break.
The cost of costs is â¬13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstruction phase has fully restored the road structure and will start to work next year in the next phase from the media to the Daugavpilip, so the whole way out of the Lithuanian border to Daugavpilip," said LVC Lange.
The country's main roads are the most burdensome, and until 2018 we are planning to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by providing time for periodic maintenance and replacement every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, be necessary to finance adequate funding, and all the road to the proposals drawn up by the expert group to put forward the road funding system," said Lange Lange.
The project is organised on a regular basis and lighting at the centre of the media.
A significant number of land work has been carried out: in four stages, large numbers of injection and injection and embracing works, a balanced road profile, which has so far been very uneven.
There are also public transport places and reconstructed areas for public transport.
In the past, there was a lack of incredible inability and the scourge of areas not to be transparent in the mountains, as well as the old way of a common hall.
The future construction season is planned to rebuild the road network from the city of Daugavities until the reconstructed phase (144,80-156.40 km).
This year, the LVC intends to work more than 1100 kilometres in a country's roads.
The information on all repairs planned in the national road network will be available on the LVC website, www.enceli.en.
"In order to achieve the desired results of reducing the weight of weight, it is very important to have the right choice of food mix," he said.
In addition, this is easy for the summer period when the fresh fruit, gas and vegetables are growing to our own garden.
The combination of peak food products can help not only to reduce overweight but also to promote a targeted variety of organisms.
Maca3 and ethics are a successful combination, because it provides a lasting sense of sentiment and helps to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical nutrition magazine have shown that the label has a positive impact on the blood levels in blood and helps us feel encouraging.
Pajon pipars and protein rich meals, such as poultry or protein cockers, do not only cause a sense of salt, but also reduce the temptation to large meals in the next few days.
Such a combination of meals can also increase the amount of calcium income-incineration in up to 35%.
Studies have shown that the Kajon pipars can help to get rid of the fans of fat.
Others contain a metic nutrient - a cholden, while the pro is a good source of vitamins C.
In the case of sufficient amounts of these nutrients, corrupt levels may be reduced, thus the accumulation of fat around the body's average.
The semi-flowing foot to which fresh oils are added is another length and fats for the brokering of the breakfast, which is worth inclusion in its food.
The rhetoric and cooking contain fibres that are controlled by the Canadian scientists in accordance with the conclusions of the Canadian Canadian Canadian scientific horse, and thus a sense of hungry.
In addition, oils contain polygolyus which are wealthy reduction, and prevent fat from being created.
Determinations and protein are also able to do miracle in reducing weight.
Such a combination can create a sense of sentiment.
Adequate water and fibre are, therefore, contributing to a sense of salt.
At the same time, protein is slowing down the process of digeating and provides a sense of salt for longer.
Over lunch, a chicken with salt or a protein cockcoon from the poorly mixture and enjoy it together with his favourite vegetables.
The combination of products should be avoided.
The high level of cugs - monosacharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch in vegetables is a polypharide.
The fruit will be mechanically mechanically mechanically, and chemically disaggregated, up to the third or fourth quarter in the digeiner process.
The starch divided into three different stages, starting in the oral question.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat on the island immediately after the meals.
It is up to the meals immediately after the meals, it is trapped in the bed with other mets, where it is not the chemical of the chemical and is starting to work.
Do not make a bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, computer or other carbohydrate products, together with citrers, I am happy, inalienable, greptaus, ananthrafe, or other acid.
Enpl ptialin, which is located in a brand, shall be limited to a rosised environment.
It is not only carbohydrate, but also contributes to the enzymes, not only to the removal of carbohydrates.
Do not take eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts, and milk and similar protein products, in one meal of meals.
It requires different digestate juice, each of them with different strength, characteristics and time when it comes to the maize.
Art, dusbands, musical and other melones must always be treated separately from other food.
It is not enough for the Melus if they are in the chair with other foods.
A combination of the economy with protein rich products.
The economy is creating a successful combination with solid, but the same cannot be said for fat and protein - fat is hampered by protein.
protein can be combined with very small fat.
If a large quantity of protein products is consumed, the fat use should be avoided.
This also applies to freshing - it is not advisable to combine large quantities of nuts (containing protein) with a healthy source (containing fat).
Such a combination shall prevent the effective reduction of weight.
How better to prepare?
"The preparation of the building, tertiary processing creates a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of products," says the report.
In most cases, nutrients are lost in loss by weakening food.
However, the nutrient value of certain foods is increasing, to be weakened.
It is also advisable to use a boat for the preparation of a bottom-up liquid, in this case, not to lose nutrients left in water, and you can eat them later.
It is advisable to draw up, too, the vapour.
The processing treatment significantly increases the availability of optical opponents of tomatoes.
In the case of tomatoes 30 minutes, the amount of opk is increasing by 25%.
It also increases the availability of biota bioethics, which can be found in red, blow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, in the sun, the sweet potprofits and the snow.
The processing of and meat for meat should be removed from the natural characteristics of the protein they present, making it easier to make it easier.
The processing of meat and eggs makes it easier to absorb the iron and other mineral substances present in these products.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamins C to 90% by up to 90%, while the freezing of fibre does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes with tomatoes, there can be an increase in the iron Readmission in an organism, which in turn provides better brain and musical activity.
Our organism takes up to 33% less of non-cardiovascular iron, which can be found in plant products such as dust, green, cereal products than cardiovascular iron, which are present in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-cardiovascular iron into an organism in the body, with the use of non-cardiovascular iron products, together with the vitamins of vitamins C, such as inhalation, tom@@
Vitamin C helps to change the cardiovascular railways so that our organism is more easily absorbed.
The Iron is necessary for the production of the hall in the form of oxygen, which provides oxygen for the museum and brain.
To be able to benefit from salt, add them healthy fat, such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing butter with reading, you will add with the rich trap of the D in the rich bread or the fence of an unadditives, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin is increasing the amount of arts into arts and has an important role to play in the development of bone.
Adequate (as well as other cereal products), together with vitamins of vitamins, such as strawberries, rivers, rains and other fruit or coal, help to stabilise cholesterol levels, and to avoid the prevalence of artery
Anpachat "Anime" has been criticised for its caring
The representatives of St chat say that this filters have inspired by animation, but some commentators say that it is racist insensitive.
With this slow effect, the St chat allows 150 million users to change reality in their daily lives and play their identity.
You could turn ourselves into a anane, dog or image into Roja LihÅ¡tenk glezin.
Len is a lashing, mutudistort instruments that generate more than 30 million transformations per day.
Any mistake is quickly becoming public.
Santichat l57 effects have already been criticised in the past, with discarded that the cost of taxation is being promoted too far or in the face of the skies, as an ideal beauty talent.
This week, new slow effects have been published, allowing users to create a mess, semi-slight dental and footwear, and some of the critics called for a racist cartoons - the 'yellow gelt'.
It was also asked whether such a contradiction does not show that the company has a greater problem with diversity.
The report and the public negligent outbreak on Wednesday, when the 'Verge' and Motherboard said that cheap effect has been removed from taxation.
The report explained that "slowly," the aim is to porte the fathers of Andee rather than caring the people of origin.
But people who have experienced racism were reminded of the painful stereotypes.
Other categorically denial of the Ankara.
A wide range of images were obtained by the American American artistic study, Greisas Sparapani, who said he was "offensive and inconvenient" as a result of the slow effect.
She added that it is difficult to disregard the visible similarities between aziates cartoons and lurges effects.
This shows that the slow effect is not simply the yellow face but the yellow face in the sense of racism.
Santichat is not the only company who has passed these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meetings to Holovor and devices used on a daily basis.
And St chat, a large audience of young people representing different race, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Srebchat lenses is set up to blame the users, "nowadays," he said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, "Medium" for the Medium "Medium" has been expelled by the Commission's St chat and recommended others to do the same.
He said that "there is a need for a" new "approach to the European Union's employment policy.
It was criticised by the company's leadership, which was mainly white men and then concluded his article with a reference to the #DeleteSimchatt.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are being taken: there are some other racial representatives in the company, but they do not take office in order to be safe and easy to express their opinion," the Chinese American, Mr or
They also agree with others, while St chat has not answered her complaint.
The company does not reveal how employees represent different race, indicating that this is a private company.
Santichat has refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but his representative found that the company has been a member of staff specialists who will focus on the presence of racial minorities, which are not widely represented and contribute to the inclusion of
But it's not up to his St chat account, adding that "interesting, if they really need more users than we can understand that this is not right."
The Congress states that military officials have missed reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Congress states that the US Council of America missed reports of war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it was in fact.
The analysts of the Central Security intelligence intelligence service show general dissatisfaction at the temporary report of the mission team set up by the Brimed forces of Brumed forces, the Committee of the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence financing, indicating that their leadership was controlled by reports of
The Central edition known as Centcom is a military base in Tampe, in Florin, which is monitoring US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report says that the intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positive than it is in fact: the facts were regularly missed by the fact that there are better achievements than other intelligence.
California, a representative of Cen Kalverta, is unacceptable: our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports. "
Centcom management errors are found at the top management of the organisation.
This 10 pages report sets out in detail the existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central Bank's efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide inconsistent evidence that the Obama administration would have had to miss reports, but it shows that the management of Centcom has given some pressure on analysts of a more optimistic view of the Islamic State (known as the other as well as the 15).
The report points out that, in the first half of 2015, the central management press, communications and reports of the Congress have shown the situation in a very positive light than it was in fact.
For example, the Centcom representatives publicly announced that the operation of Mosul could start as early as April 2015 or May 2015.
Mosua is the second largest city of Iraq, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In his report, Mr Maiko said that "a number of months of investigations have been made clear."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the central officials of the US Central Bank missed reports of the threat of the Environment to weaker Iraq than they were in fact.
The presidential party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about Islamic state is being missed.
The report will be followed by new findings on Thursday.
The Director-General of the Defence Ministry is carrying out an investigation of the activities of Centcom intelligence.
The members of the Group of the Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the party party working party.
Addressing the report, the representative of the European Parliament, Addressing the report, said in his report that Centcom was too limited from 2014 to 2015 to the preparation of the assessment reports of the intelligence services in relation to the
Mr Schifa explains that the process "suspended the dissemination of information," exacerbated the work of analysts and spread the truth. "
However, he added that there was no evidence that the White Nit has put pressure on Centcom analytists to draw up reports according to the "pre-defined or political position."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress's investigation on Thursday.
In August, the New York Times said that the Pentagon General Inspection opened an investigation after Centcom analysts complaints.
Pentagon's representative, Patrand Evans, said that the Pentagon will not comment on the Congress's report until the investigation continues.
He added that experts sometimes interpret the complex data, and the Defence Ministry and the intelligence administration call for constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not only about the question of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (the claim expressed by the representatives of the Defence Ministry).
But last year's charges call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports of the Central Bank on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism for the intelligence of Islamic State is reminds more than ten years of events, when Centcom intelligence analysts Gregorum were made public by a study, stating that the administration of the Bush had launched a Afghan war, with too little thought about the possible consequences of it.
They played an important role in opening the intelligence of the Islamic State.
Last year, official representatives reported that HkKs have discovered that, as opposed to public reports, air flights have not significantly deteriorated the financial position of the terrorist groups, as they were built a temporary factory to sell oil on the market.
The Times reported on the occasion that this disclosure did not come outside the Central System.
At the moment, Centcom commander General Lohm Ostins III received a strong criticism, because many lawmakers considered that war reports describe the situation too positive.
In April, General Orops leave and came to a General General Votels.
The United States of America, with Britain in the field of women's field, can win the US in the fourth round of a row.
On Thursday, Japan has been the first two in the United States, the Americans and the US.
The five wins in two games are a forward-looking achievement, but the 27 years old said that it would not be possible to remember whether they had already been able to do so.
She said 'I have no idea'.
I am not of those people who have been the number of their gates.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them the same group with Britain, which, on Thursday, after a victory of 2: 0, remained won.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday on Saturday to play the first round of the wall.
The two teams have already qualified a quarter of the game and the game will determine only what the team will take the first place in the six team group and the second.
The winner of the first place will take a little longer from meeting with the strong Dutch read, which is the leader of the second group.
As well as the face of Saturday, the Americans have already called a surprise in the storm four years ago in London in the last place between 12 teams.
The team also had Blank
She was up in the scrap, the field of the field was in the hands of his first time in the first three years (her old husband was already working with this type of sport Dief) and the national lag joined when she was 16 years old.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because I did not have the finalists.
However, 2012 was a failed year for her and her team.
In the next year, the English Kregs Parham was appointed and all changed to the good side.
It was called 'cultural, mentality and physical change'.
In London, we did not invest so much as now.
We have changed everything completely.
It was the first time in the first half of the year.
India was in a position without victory in his own account, but it was very comfortable and held a minimum result of 0: 1 to up to the end of the third period, when Basque was reproduced.
She entered a bomb in a blank area with the left, and it was up to the middle of the field and to send a bomb in the guns with 2: 0.
In the fourth half of the year, the Melis was even one.
It was the first of the US's US gate in the daughter, in each of the first three games.
She has been.
And the same is true.
"We are going very well now," said Pahit, but how well it will show the game.
The most pressing mediet of the depression period is the "Intelligent meter"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the presidential office, the Lenseta Delano Rhase seed in the oar room in order to hold a meal.
President Riga wrote to the demarcation of the fine cultury, such as the overexploitation of the boat, and the sun and Merceland.
However, she was much more modest in his meal: egg tomatoes, potatoes, deserts and deserts.
Dgeina Ziegelmane says: 'This is a way of solidarity in the preparation of the food with people who have been very hard. "
Her husband added: "This is also a message for the Americans, as we should eat."
Others from Brown Hewady Hewady are the historians.
In the final book of the Cole, the Chinese virus in America was described, but Ziegelmane in his book '97 in 97' describes life through meals in Manchetene.
Their new joint work, the "Intelligent malmete" will be published on Tuesday at Harper, the story of the American depression during the Great Depression.
To show some solidarity in the cultury, they held the meals together with the Eisting's Sandwich Shop, "the simple lunch, which is in the area of Flatirona and operating from 1929 when a major depression of depression.
For 54 years old Ziegelmanes was commissioned for butter with a seated cheese and captured olive, while a 57 years old, the potato betty of the potatoes and the island of the vegetables.
When he commissioned a counterfeit green, a couple of recognised that his choice is very appropriate to the conversation of the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmanes told us that the counterfeit green was very popular.
It was the guns of the land, the accrt of the accrue and the glass.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
It seems to be that this is the case that so many of the land are in place to be lunch.
Mr Kou was shot.
"It would probably seem that it would seem to be a complete pigs," he said.
In the case of the predecessor, the Swedish head of the American lunch was in the process of Swedish, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men, workers and breakfast, lunch, and the arts were given to be fresh.
In the first World War, the Americans were sending Europeans with their meals. "The good vertebrate described how the Americans adapt to the circumstances when America suddenly was no longer the land.
"At that time, we became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," said Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
The new budget was just as important: uncertain mets such as counterfeit green and indignation became a daily day, the indignation was "an excellent way of using surpluses," said Mr Ziegelmanes, as he could be hindered by an unhesitable component of the crystal.
The fruit was replaced by cheap fruit.
The meat that has been the main part of the American meter for years now became an extremely rare luxury.
At a time when the number of calcium and the food value were more important than long, young, unseen forms were not yet seen.
In the long term in the Ziegelmanes, Mrs Ziegelmanes found a prescription to draw up the polls of the butter.
Mr Kou added: 'It was not a popular lunch of lunch.'
Mrs Ziegelmanes emphasises: 'It was a real'.
The butter and the pockets are not compatible.
Many homes were in difficult times.
household economists such as the Lua Stenin, the head of the Federal Office of Household, from 1923 to 1943, laid down a country's eating habits which had not been experienced before the Great Depression or
By publishing articles and prescription newspapers and magazines, they recommended that they become "economist" and adopt challenges such as converting the mackerel and the carpet on the horse meal.
"The good Maltese" is a historic spiritual.
There is particularly interesting evidence of the attitude of the government towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Hing, let me eat the attitude.
Although he told him about his simple childhood and catering Aioin, he actually eat as a fine million, for which he had become.
Mr Kou tells: 'He was paved the way for a European virus, for example, for the mayor of cucumcue. "
He's almost a gold in a gold washer.
He was completely out of reality.
President Ring would have allowed the same mistake if his wife Eleonora would not have recommended him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book told us that Ring is a domestic workers, who did not learn to eat, so the White Nit became a place where not only one of the most untapped meals was given in Washington, but it is also worse for the food.
As soon as the country's economy is saved, the majority of the depression of the depression of the country's economy.
But we continue to pay attention to calicalies and value and how to use science in the cultury, Mrs Ziegelmanes.
It is a fact that, when writing a book, they won a greater understanding of the motherhood of Mrs Ziegelmanes, for example, why she was unable to throw out on the eve.
"She's really feared to get out of the day," he said.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said: 'She actually put people on board.'
Then there was an incident with wind.
When we were eating Eisenberga, a couple of writers discovered the desert at home: the Faculty of the flowers, which President Rmaset used in lunch.
"This is a blow poll," said Ziegelmanes, adding that at that time the habited habits of modest meals had been distributed.
It does not have a blank blow, just dried flows, a little mild, sugar, water and caneath.
All the impoverishment of the war in the wall of the war that came to the semi-light.
It was not as bad as ever.
Mr Kou was appalled by some of the coumts.
"When you listen to a experienced 'economics', he said the wife's wife was the lap of the sun.
The GLead will receive repayment of legal expenses in the fight against Merck on Hepatitis C
The judge has decided that "Ganad in Inc Inc" has the right to be returned to the services of lawyers paid in the case of a Hepatitis C patent against Merck & Co inc.
In June, Gvad was justified for the fines of 200 million pounds of two Merck patents, which were threatened by the successful Sove and Harvan tablets, when the US federal judge found irregularities in the operation of Merk, for example, by the oath of a oath and other unethical activities.
On Thursday, a judge from the United States, BeBetisons Facle, said that Gvad is the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to obtain the position on the market against GLead dominating the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C medicinal products that are effective for 90% of the olive diseases.
The case has already been launched in 2013, when Ganad and Merck were in charge of each other in trying to obtain ownership of the new active component of sopbuvis, which is the main part of the G@@
The forces supported by the US say that they have fully taken over control over the city of Manwad from Islamic State.
The forces supported by the US over their control over the northern part of the city of the city in the northern part of Turkey and the latest Islamic State soldiers have left the city, the representative of the group announced Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Democrats, SDS, are currently retraining cities from the last opponents of opponents who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2000 civilians from civilians who have been killed by the fighters, the news agency Reuters, Sarfans, of the SDS allies of the military council in Manva.
"At the moment, the city is in complete control of our control and we are taking the fighters' search," he said.
Clinton income in 2015 reached USD 10.75 million and a few repayment of 34,2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton published the 2015 tax declaration, which shows that the presidential candidate and her husband had earned USD 10,75 million in this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34,2 percent respectively.
In 2015, Clinton has donated USD 1 million, mainly in its Clinton charity organisation, the former president, Bilds Clinton, has earned around 5.3 million dollars, and the former state has won 3 million dollars from his books on the Departame.
Clinton's election allies, the Senator of the United States in Washington, Tims Keins and his wife Anna Hollinton, published his tax declaration on the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tims Kes are continuing to set new standards of financial transparency," Clinton said in a statement in his statement.
On the other hand, the Danube is hiding behind various pretext and reservations, so that the promises to discover his tax information.
The publication of the tax information tax is recorded in the US presidential candidates, but does not require a law.
In New York, Trump and his lawyer mentioned the audit of the National Public Prosecutor as a reason to discover tax information.
"I've been a march," he said, on his Twitter, the tax information of the Democratic Party's candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Maiker, told the CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax information before the audits were completed.
The critics of Trump, including the presidential candidate in 2012, MMP, and others say his refusal to raise questions about his real size of property, the amounts of donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton added the oil to the seamen, published on Friday with a video of a number of influential players to make his tax information public.
She went back to this issue again during the economic speech on Thursday.
She said "he refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
"In the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes," he said.
Federal tax rates are a key issue for the presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the VP proposal, is promoting the idea that anyone earning more than USD 1 million a year has to pay at least 30% a year.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week Clinton, Nemascia, where his' Berkshire Hathaway 'conglomerate, was also in conglomerate, called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
The Baft said he also had a tax service, and Trump is afraid of voters rather than tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton is now living in the Church, New York, and has paid the average federal tax rate of around 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of around 40.5 per cent.
Clinton in 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are salary.
Their main investment was a low cost index fund from which Clinton has received â¬109,000 in dividends.

EJeg's French film director said in social media that Kempski Bristol was not available in Berlin for a Israeli interlocutor.
The King Lancman, documentary film for holocaust Shoah, will not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Wempski Bristol, the hotel and address the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancman was trying to find an Israeli talks on the list proposed by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries which can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been wiped and destroyed?
This is not the case.
Instead, Kempski Bristol offers a hotel to the country through its call centre.
The regime asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer received "shocked".
The head of the hotels explained that "it was an informed hotel decision."
The reason for the withdrawal of the code was even more heated by the film director.
"Most of the guest are in the Arab code and they asked for the exhibition of Israel's code," Lancman said.
Sudan's ambassador in Germany, Jakov Had-Handelsman, said that the Israeli ambassador Jakov was "big shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
It is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, precisely in this hotel network, is even more humiliating.
Notification is not necessary.
"We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event was also a rather widespread one on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempski hotel was simply fed by Arab customers.
A other record was said to be a shame, saying that the hotel was on the streets of Kurvstendamm with synagogy.
The expenditure Der Sandgel said that the hotel was quickly rejected by all the discarded, stating that it was "misunderstanding" and apologised to Lancmanam.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the national number of national lists," Kempski, a representative of Sudan.
And to add that the code once again added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters in Brazil.
The clashes of students and police were held on Thursday in the city of Santa in Brazil, where students gathered a demonstration against reform of government education systems.
The police used a rubber window and tear gas to students.
The problems started when the law was tried by the Ombudsman, leading to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
A number of students took part in the demonstration to show their disappointment towards reform of the education system.
The proposal by the Governor of Sandouli, Geraldo Alckmina, aims to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators were marked on the wall with messages against the interim President Maikla Tishu.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for the deceated President, Mr Dai Sesefia, who was the Senate.
Scotland's first, gold meal for cycles
In the last night, in the last night, the British team, who won the last night in London, was the first team of men's team, who won the last night.
A 23 year old athlew was playing an important role in this combustion, making a proud legary of the conservative, Serbian Krisu Hoes and the winning New Zealand.
Fifty years ago, Britain had a surprise victory when he wrote a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it in the World Cup in London, even though Hooy has already completed his athletes's career.
The problems were at the stage between Beijing and the London Olympic Games, because it had to be replaced by an experienced fact-finding specialists in Stafia Stafu.
They managed it at the last minute.
When he went out, he was trying to fill the place in Chechs Emadi and Mempton.
British coaches made their hope on the Slint, looking at the potential he has shown later.
The Hindes, Kenya, the champions, who started with the Hotel and Skiners four years ago, set a record of the Olympic Games, but a better start in New Zealand.
However, British trio won gold medals.
The Hindes was close to his poll, Kenya said, and the Skink was protected by the Siners.
The change in the strategy has played an important role in the victory, because Hindes travel with more carry-overs in order to allow Kenya and in particular to travel more quickly.
The BBC was watched as BBC and shot in the Skink, Kenya and Hindesa at a time when they went to the pip.
A 23 year old glass said that "it was an unintended honour."
I do everything to defend my name.
We set up the Olympic record and the World Cup.
That was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After the victory, together with Kenya and Hoe in 2012 the Olympic Games in London, Hindes will be aware that deliberately down the trawl after the failed start.
He then found his comment and the British competitors did not have the opposite.
This time was not an incident.
Hindes said: "Britain's flags have been withdrawing London."
Over the last 3 months we have become a frozen team.
We have lost so many World championships, so the victory of the Olympic Games was really special.
One medals will be in a state that won seven of the ten gold medals in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the rate of team progress over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the results of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of HoHols with three of the Olympic gold medals.
Kenya would mean six gold gold and one silver meal; also Kenya was born on 23 March (it seems to be British newspaper, as Strase was also born on the day, Mo Farah, and Banks Banks.
The Hotel was also born on that date.
Kenya is a tension for the next three days.
A 28 year old sport from Botton said that I would just enjoy it.
Comprehensive travel is always the best.
Because then we can win together with team members.
If it is fair, it is a little alone. "
Hindu said: "If he won another two gold medals, he would have to appoint an arms."
On that day it was the only fight for medals, but they were not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bretlii, the Ed Klensiy, is an MEP in Stalins and Oveins Douls, who has been the fastest time of qualification for four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World Cork, which was launched in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the finalists will take place today in the second half of the day, where they will certainly be at the heart of the focus.
Yesterday, before his qualifications, he had a disagreement with the Commission when the judges called him to measure his growth.
The report was adopted with 516 votes in favour, 14 against and 24 abstentions.
The British delegation hopes that British cycling team will fight the Olympic Games in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and former performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements to be the same.
In the meantime, there has been a variety of ways in which the accusations of the secular and the dignity of the dignity have been resigned, the technical Director has resigned the technical Director, Mr Marina Saton, and the career
However, in the first place of cycling, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level in the right time.
The future of Portland has become uncertain because an ambitious treaty has been interrupted.
Aluminium, the future of the Portlenum in Portlena, has been uncertain as its main customer has announced the interruption of cooperation.
This communication is based on the plans of the Hungarian Government to end the subsidisation of energy companies, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
20 years of subsidies will be suspended in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 Alcou Portlenland works at risk.
There could be a risk of up to 2000, both directly and indirectly.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as it consumes around 10 per cent of the overall electricity supply.
In 2014 Alcoa was covered by the "point Henry" of the "Point Henry" which led to a break in the operation of the England power plant.
The Alcoan Portlende has been working with loss and can be closed.
These events caused several years of speculation on the rise in the value of the dollar dollar and the cost of factory production.
AGL's energy supplier, "AGL," which supply energy from its "Loy YanA" power plant in the Latvian power plant, said the other three owners are likely to stop their contracts.
The majority of power stations include Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the company's share of Chinese CITIC and Japan Marubeni Corp.
AGL looks forward to the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies to the slaughterhouse, "he said.
AGL said that the contracts are so-called "restrictive contracts" to enter into force from November 2016.
The Treaties are the period of validity of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"The AGL is planning to receive revenue from these contracts in 2017," he said.
From 2018, the potential impact of the fiscal year on profits is limited to a favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
AGL states that in its forecasts the loss of EUR 187 million has already been taken into account by providing that these contracts will be terminated.
"Alcoa" says that the decision to put an end to contracts will not affect the possibility of the Alcoa's ability to continue to operate and supply energy.
The US company said that in 2010 it has concluded a contract with Loy Yanch for 20 years, but in November it will be cut off, with no explanations of why it will stop cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern both about the possible closure of Portlenland in the orphan and the closure of the Tomago factory close to the NNB, the weak economy.
The Executive Director of AGL Storen Mikelson last week said that, after analysts, Portlena spent 600 megagats and Tomago 900 megavaton energy in the year.
If both factories leave the energy market, energy demand will be reduced significantly.
And that would not be good.
160 000 people reject the Community legal centre every year.
Every year more than 160 000 people have been rejected and the situation could deteriorate in the budget.
Three out of five people in the Kwwa, mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight against illegal extinction, are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overburdened, warns that the reduction in funding will only be worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
The Director of the Committee on Legal Affairs of Kowland Fareon said that the latest Association Report by the Association of National Legal Centre (CERC) states that thousands of people in need are refused legal aid.
He said that the situation will only be worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre of KWBs is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is refused to thousands of people in need. "
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are experiencing divorce, workers who are disproportionately dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
From June 2017, the Federal Government of June will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousands of KWWs will have to address their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the prosecutors and the KWWP Senator, George Brandisa, to immediately stop the reduction in funding so that people who need legal assistance can obtain this.
Last year, the government found its plans to build a level of legal aid to the average level of the country.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to the government of Palazchuka to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign brought court to court because some of the workers disappear
New York: the organisers of Trump's campaign were brought before the court because they did not have acted with information that they opened a firearm to a person in North warn's operation, when they had taken one car in February.
This incident was described in the case of the Court of Justice, which was submitted to the German Court of Justice on Wednesday, a former campaign programme.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months to start the case, but it was understood that it would not happen.
The driver, in the hall, was discovered by the hall, put his good finger on the meal and opened a lag against the long run.
He also argues that he had made complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four people have experienced the same.
"It's not to be extinct to create losses," he said.
Only two days before the submission of the case, the candidate of the Republics has caused a scandal by stating to people that 'people of the Second Amendment', i.e. arms owners and enthusiasm, could act in the event of the election of his defeat.
Trump's campaign said that the media had displayed his words from the context and he never fed to violence.
Bordini with his request, it wants compensation from the campaign organisers for negligence, but from the Philippines, on an attack, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's representative Houl Hiksa did not comment immediately.
It has not been possible to communicate with the Philippines.
The WCCB - the local news agency of Å arlou, says that the Philippines have recently left a campaign.
It has also failed to call his advice firms' Innovation Consultation Services'.

A new tradition - the cold and the blessing of sport in the coin.
On Saturday, in the Cellik, the first people brought together the cold and sport.
Ten years later, it was decided that the Ezer will no longer be any longer.
A new page has now been broken down.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time, the competition was not traditional and too serious, because, for example, the dire was to be left in the wall, the boy of the man with the left, the bumbling of the man, has not been a single Olympic Games.
However, every member could show how strong, brave, performance and attachment he is.
After sports games, all of us came to a leisure working, where we started a blessing.
In the meantime, a child's corner was working, where the small could disappear in the wall in the wall and to get a new image in the poory.
The innovation that could also become a tradition was the debt of a driving vehicle that went to both tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone spoke of the management head of the KPRs, Inga Gaddafi, who wished a nice rest and a dry time, rainly burned, but this was not the case.
The Hooks continued with the windfall of the younger population.
Indeed, it is a good thing that five girls and one leftist have been added.
The eve of the coerers of the bee had come from Engures in Engures - the viewers of a very loaded angry in the autumn.
And that is not the case that the wet was on the table.
It is of course that the local people and villages, the famous of the acuals, have been the famous man in Jenis and Dainis Porganic, who was once again in Millaan, and the 'day' of the Kruman, as well as the instigated wife of the
"It was the Brand," I said.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend the Hytroy.
It will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hytroit very attractive, as is in London in 2012, where we put a huge amount of work to the benefit of all the regions of the country from the Olympic Games.
It was a great deal of the Olympic Games.
And we will do this again by ensuring local citizens and businesses with business opportunities far from Hytroit.
In local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to the unemployment of young people in the Chytroit area.
Like the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too high and that the expansion of Hytroit is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain will never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games, and that it will be a global failure.
It was wrong for 2012 and, in the case of Hytroit, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hytroit has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hytroit is a infrastructure project which will benefit the whole society and not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, the economic growth of 211 billion, creating the soil for both employment and experience in this airport and across Britain.
It works an excellent team, which has created a investment programme of 11 billion polar infrastructure, with the time and the budget starting from the terminal 5 years of the best airport terminals in the world and at the end of the terminal to the terminals of 2.
Now they are ready to set up a third of the RM which will be financed through private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London Olympic Games 2012 was an excellent success, and I am sure that this will also be the enlargement of Hanthrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand the Hytrotrole, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Deiton is a member of the board of the Hytroit board and former Minister of Economic Affairs of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman is on the road to try to make suicide.
The other night went on the road.
The police is trying to find witnesses in the event of an accident on Thursday from the morning to her on the road.
The accident took place shortly after midnight to A1 on the road to A1 in the city of Co canton.
In the case of Vo cantona police report, desperately wanted to make suicide, a woman has taken on the dark of the road, where he was travelling several cars.
Clearly, in trying to kill itself, the victims, 49 years old, came a number of cars, including heavy machinery.
His died.
A number of drivers involved in the event have already given evidence, but others have not yet been clarified, says the police, who call for the drivers to be able to use the drivers and witnesses.
The case has also been launched by a criminal investigation which, in this case, is a logical step, an opportunity for Le Manune de Geneve told the lawyer, Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether one of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid clashes?
Hofsters add: "It will be clear by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrians have gone on the road at the end of the night, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that there will be a pedestrian in the middle of night.
Last year, one policeman was justified in killing behind the neglect when she came to a man who had been left to A1 road near Payerland in August 2014.
The Court of Justice found that a 22 years old victim had been drink and noticed the road later.
The Court concluded that the police, who was on the road to the place of the accident, had been driving the conditions in an appropriate manner and the judge recognised that the winning man was "completely unpredictable and exceptional."
Anyone who has information on the accident on Thursday close to Morls is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
In the Internet, signatures are collected for the organisation of a new VD.
The collection portal was launched by Avaaz.org in the collection of a new country's head of public revenue (VID).
In the case addressed by the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Union of the Greens / Farmers (Greens / Farmers), the public wants a transparent and professional process for the appointment of officials.
It was set up on 10 August and has now signed 55 people.
The process for the appointment of the Directorate General of the VID, Inga Kolegova, is a transparent and unprofessional.
It does away with the best functioning traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredit public administration and once again makes public disappointment in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria, to be assessed by all candidates," the petition text said.
He said that "there are no criteria for the public," he said.
It is also also clear what the candidates are doing in the VID.
The report points out that the national cancellery should be set up by a new open competition which will actively address professional candidates, be linked to staff selection experts and offer appropriate remuneration.
The Finance Minister Dana Reizizces-Ozola has formally put forward the post of Kolegova's office last week, the government was expected to approve his new office this week, but the Unity ministers voted against, so the week was postponed
Samotrav: if we lost, so I was bad.
Alexander Samotrav and Jlanis have hoped to be the winner of the Olympic Games at the Olympic Games in Rioeiro, but there is no difference in the competition.
One of the most powerful beaches of the world is in the hall and a decisive game with 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15, 7: 15, 7: 15).
In three subgroups the Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was two couples.
In the end, three couples of the small points of the interval have been counted that the Latvian durability was most unfavourable after this poll.
"In the first six, we were under way, but from 16: 15, it remains to 16 points," the game remembered.
I do not know how there was no point in the remaining part of the sitting.
It must not play.
In the second half, everything was in order and the game was in place and it had to be good for the third six.
The result was that they started in the same way, but after we have changed the parties, only one team.
We had too many errors in attack.
In the sub-group, all teams were similar, almost in all the pockets, so the small points were important.
"We had to play more closely than back the 3-4 points in a row."
We know that Evane can be wiped out.
"In the first six, we're going to deal with it," he said.
We tried to show the best game.
The rice came, I would like not.
I was aware of the situation before the nowadays, but we know that as many small points as possible.
"If we lost," he said.
Of the Evane, we had a good server and it was quite good to deal with it in the first six, but the third was open to him and it was difficult to have an attack.
On the other hand, I was making a lot of wrong to the Pee serve, but it was to deal with it.
SamoENVI said that, contrary to the previous pockets today, athletes have not voiced the voices.
"We'll have been able, but protection was, but it was better to get it."
"They played well and at the end of the end."
Before he said it was the most convenient that could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even from the group.
"All of us were waiting for medals and we also come from, but then there has been no difference," said Samoliv, who predicted that he would continue to play in the future.
I think there will be no question and will continue to play together, because this is just one room.
Samohad was already in the third Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, as he was in Beijing in 2008, with MMartiu Pabinet, but a four years ago in London, he played a part in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second start in the Olympic Games.
"Latvia is also following the opening process of the gas market, also from a potential trader position.
The country's energy company, Latvia, is following the opening of the gas market, both from the consumer and the potential trader, said the company's press spokesman Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether the future" Latvia "gas market will also join the trader will determine what the gas market model and the legal framework will be set up."
"That is why, on my part, we are actively involved in establishing legislation and in comments, as well as presenting our proposals," Mr Bidere said.
The BNS has already wrote that the Ministry of Economic Services, in cooperation with the Public Service regulation Commission and the Energy companies of Latvia, has developed a draft "Dabnatural gas trade and use rules" of Ministers of Ministers, which will change the principles of the functioning of the natural gas market from 2017.
In working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim is to make the trade process of natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly handling solution chosen by the trader's central model, where all activities relating to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoices and one of the provision of information and customer service, the technical issues of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
Recalling that household users have a gradual market opening, even after 3 April 2017, their domestic customers who do not want to choose another natural gas traders will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader on a regulated price, thus becoming an end to
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to users of regulated prices is determined by the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, economic operators will have to choose the natural gas trader with which the natural gas trade agreement is to be concluded.
As long as the conclusion of a natural gas agreement is to be concluded for a certain period of time, operators of natural gas shall ensure that natural gas trade is provided to the existing natural gas trader.
The draft provisions of the Ministerial Cabinet detailed detailed rights and obligations for natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the procedures for the supply of natural gas and the cessation of supply, the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the trader, the system operator, the user and the layout of the site for the supply and use of natural gas, the interest in the payment of the natural gas to the public by the public trader, the level of the interest in the payment of the natural gas

At the same time, Reization Ozola said that the head of the National Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good Director General of the VID.

Oil prices continue to rise; an increase in exchange index in the US and Europe, as well as the US dollar value.
The oil prices in the world are continuing to rise on Friday morning, with investors having a positive impact on the statements of the Saudi Arabia Minister in Saudi Arabia, which reinforce the expectations that the largest oil winter countries will take action at the OPEC meeting in the
The three main US exchange index reached a record level on Thursday, which was not observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial figures of several companies on Thursday were also due to the rise in the European stock index.
The US dollar's dollar increased on Thursday against the euro, with regard to the British pound and against Japan.
In September, the price of the WTI of crude oil in the WTI was increased by 1.78 percent to 43.49 dollars per barrel on Thursday.

The "Blue lag" turnover of the Desertor producer last year is 33. 8%.
The "Blue lap" turnover in the Blue lap last year was â¬4.202 million, which is 33. 8% less than the year before, while the company's losses fell by 5.7 times to 904,7 million in the annual financial statement.
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company worked with losses caused by a number of reasons, including the permanent lack of funds caused by the leaving of the Unicreper Bank from the Baltic market, by the end of the existing credit line, and leaving the 'Blue lagyon' with contracts.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a discount.
The lending of the banks concerned to Latvia's market also deny the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds which would have allowed the production industry to buy new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
In the same way, the company's financial sector has had a negative impact on the rise in prices of raw materials and the reluctance of customers to pay more than the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers found price changes and they were ready to buy goods for new - higher prices," said the company's management.
In 2015, the Blue lag started discussions with potential investors, including the assessment of the company's movement and real estate.
Investories have already been the largest creditor of Unicreper Leing, where the parties have known and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the business and development of the company has had a positive impact on the implementation of the plan for restructuring and optimisation of 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement of technological processes and optimisation that makes it possible to achieve greater production productivity and capacity.
"We have been bought a number of facilities that provide greater production speed," the company's management said.
"The Blue lag leadership notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow companies to carry out orders that have not been possible until now.
The first production party that will be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the operational protocols on the sale of the product have already been signed, the whole produced will be sold in line with the declarations of intention.
The new product will increase the turnover of around 300 000 euros per month.
In August 2016, the company intends to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish production to Iraq.

As a result of the repair, a man is betrayed and forced to leave the house.
The LTV programme, "4.studying", went to Dmitry Saidjayev, a neighbour of capital repair in his own country, and since then Dmitry from the ceiling of the ceiling, there is no doubt that there was a safe stay.
The problem is that my neighbours made arbitrary construction and in my own country the ceiling has been damaged.
Then I informed the Riga building board, the authorities of the House and other organisations.
The management board said that we are not a operational service and we have no expert.
"The live owner must go to Latvia's Engineers' union, and there will be an expert," Dmitry said.
The invited expert came out of the request and has said that the cover was unsatisfactory.
However, since the first submission of the Dmitry, a month has passed a month and no one was able to respond to the beginning of this week, whether there is no danger of life.
The building board said that it is legislation, waiting if you are not satisfied, write all the row.
"Then I wrote Riga's domicile, but they sent to the head of the House, then the remanager of the House, once again, to the construction board, and then there is an impasse."
After all the paper, it is clear that construction works are halted, when they can hear that someone is working there.
There is a need for a two-month expertise to be carried out and the owner of six months of living, who carry out repairs, to prevent all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up its opinion, but it considers it incomplete and superfluous.
Experts have not indicated whether the metal of the metal of the metal that is not present is affected by this uncertain structure, and it is therefore not convinced that a threat to the holder of the subsistence residential.
"That is why we have requested additional clarification from this expert," Ilze Å½am, a representative of the Riga city of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper living, it is still heard that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without construction permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a specific case, the penalty can be much more severe.
As long as an expert opinion is expected, the Management Board has taken a decision that both residential living must not be exploited, both in which construction works are held and Dmitry's living.
"This is an accident in the practice of the construction board, where it is in such a way that its knowledge or simply does not want the citizens to have a threat not only to their own property but also to the subownership of the property owner, as a result of which the owner
Now Dmitry remains to look for another place where you live - to live, friends, hotel or rental another.
But the damage caused by Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbour's civil law, which can take a very long time.
In the case of open construction, there is currently a ban on both living in both residential areas, until cabin engineers will give their conclusion and can wait for even three weeks.
The loss of losses will have to be borne by the owner of the home in which the repairs occurred.
The owner of this residence is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months.

When asked about both relations, "Rolling Stone" said: "They are really good."
We felt at the time.
As long as we entered, she was sitting on the reinforced.
Most groups could not tolerate it.
We were able, but not very successful, because we were very tight.
We were not secular but girls did not get to the record, they allowed us to work.
When the Don was met with Joko, she was not left in the room, but in the middle of our four.
The "Yellow Submarine" author also recognised a regular contact with the former group Ringo, and the entry of Apple "Apple plans," but otherwise "Beatles" are "to work."
The question is whether he still met with the only one in his own conservative cabinet, "Rolling Stone said," "often not."
We meet social measures and balls.
However, I am not absent at meetings, I feel a little.

NASA climate model: the Venice area was once populated
Based on the latest climate models of NASA, the Venice is once a populable planet.
NASA Godarda's space research institutes have developed a model to explore the history of the Venice, using tools and alicithms, which are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venice, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, which consists of almost exclusively carbon from carbon, at the same time as the land similar.
Researchers have already said in advance that the Venice slow speed of the Venice is to be explained with a deny atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation shows that the Venice was at the forefront of the plan, the land similar to the ground and turned slowly.
The model also look at the Venice of the Venice.
There has been more dry areas on the planet than on the Earth, but there were enough water and geographical diversity to be able to form life and prevent the water from being invasive.
In the past Venice, the Sage was at 30 per cent.
GISS's simulation model in Ventera reveals that the day of the day on which the day of the day of 2 months, GISS said in a press release.
This process warns the surface of the planet and leads to a case which, in turn, creates a frightening cloud of clouds that operate as the umbrella to protect the planet from the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature that is, in fact, a few degrees lower than the temperature per Earth.
The model of the Venice history that is similar to the theory of evolution by scientists in their hypothesis.
Although it was once populated over a billion billion years, the Venice had been subjected to too much heat and ultrats.
The oceans were tasked with the ultrations of the ultrations of the ultrations.
It was only through the carbon atmosphere of the plan that we know today, the Venice that we know today.
Researchers published the results of the new Venice climate model in gamaysical Research Letters.
Avalanche
Avalado Avalanche, who was a member of the Avalanche, and the Vice-President of the hockerel operations, submitted a request for a request for a team's decision in the decision-making process.
The college and the General Adviser will have confirmed the news and said that the club will start to seek new training.
"In the last three years I have been vigorously committed to its responsibilities as the main coach and the collusion of the Colcion," he said.
During this summer I have thought a lot about how I could improve team performance in order to give it the necessary spheres and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the main training and hocle operation must be fully coincided with the vision of the organisation's vision.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning the performance of the team.
These conditions are now not met.
On 23 May 2013, the time who hacked the Roy thanked Roy for his contribution team.
I said that the Patrice was informed of her decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him all the best.
In his first season with Avalanche, Roy was recognised as a leftist coacher and received the award award for the Avalanche.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and the first place in Central District Dialogues, but in the first round of the defeat in Colorado, the Colorado of Minesota, the club of the club, has for two

The workers of the North Sea oil platform are reopening the negotiations and delaying the strike
The workers' strikes on the remuneration of workers from the North Sea oil platform are postponed because the two parties involved in the dispute have reopened negotiations, the leaders of the negotiators.
The Periodic Film Group, Wood Group, is organised by strikes to the North Sea oil platforms operating by Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that 'Wood Group' and Unite, and RMT, have agreed to resume negotiations on settlement of the dispute.
In the coming weeks, a number of full days of meeting have been foreseen, which will start at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-considering the problematic issues.
Trade unions said that the recent measures organised after a break of more than 25 years are against the planned reduction in wages.
As a result of the negative market pressure, the increase in wages of 9 per cent in the North Sea was reduced this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The report calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that there is no need for the Commission to ensure that the Member States are able to ensure that they are able to live in the market.
The Shell has already reduced wages for several thousands of people and announced plans to end oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimise their work in preparation for a large-scale merger deal with the British energy company BG Group.
The energy companies are under pressure because of the falling oil prices, and the situation is more difficult for British decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Parliament, Deivs, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are intended to invest almost USD 1.4 billion, compared to USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
It's a stark of a stars of the star.
The latest Keeper's Teleskopa mission has helped astronomy to collect the most complete catalogue of stars in the speed of a star.
The new data help astronomus to understand why stars in this stars are going to the different speed, as well as the way in which the speed of the stars applies to the planet.
"We hope that we will get more information on the link between stars, age and even the history of the solar system," said Caltech at the World Caltech and the Analaltical Centre.
The stars are at 445 per cent of light away from the earth.
Many stars are only starting to rise in this stars, reaching around 125 million years.
Its return to the maximum speed.
In the case of the maximum speed, this growing stars are distributed by wind stars.
They are braking stars in the magnetic field of the stars.
Far from ageing, the speed is falling.
Keeping each stars at the speed of each star, setting the time between the identifiable stars area, such as solar panels.
The latest catalogue of stars shows that more stars are slower than less stars.
The rear compared to the stars with the wet, more growth is carried out in the pirates slower than a small growth.
The rear tells us that 'white' shows the slow and massive roof of rotating sites, while the rotating sites are very small stars.
It serves as a great space laboratory, thanks to the fact that the stars are so close, where the characteristics of stars can be compared to the speed speed.
The rear says that it helps to build theoretical models on the part of stars in both directions, both older and younger stars.
We still have to learn a lot of lessons, how and why, and why the speed of the stars will slowly be slowed and the process of taking full stop.
The Rebult and his colleagues were presented in detail on the analysis of the speed of the Car on the three new publications that will soon be published in Ausomia.
