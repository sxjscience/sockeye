A 28-year-old doctor found dead in the ancient supermarket of San Francisco
This week, a 28-year-old story was found in a superior building in a superstar, which recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to go across his brother, saying: "His life started to improve."
A member of the 28 year old San Francisco citizen, Paul Galicia, was identified as a 28-year old superstar at Vesthale, a spokesman for the San Francisco Court's medical expertise, said.
The San Francisco police said that his death was declared murder and that an investigation is under way.
His brother Luis Galicia told Sanfrancal KGO CGO that he had previously worked as a coin in Boston, but six months ago he was working in his dream at the Sons & Daughters Sanfranciska.
The spokesman for the Sons & Daughters of Sons informs that the news of his death was shocked and shocked by them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and will miss him very much," he said.
At this difficult time, we are looking to the French friends and the family.
Luis Galicia tells him that he was naive in Hostels at the beginning, but that life had finally improved.
"He came in a new apartment and met a girl with some girl," Luis told the radio station in the KGO.
Loiss Galicia said he did not know who would go over his youngest brother.
He was a good man with a great heart.
"He always missed his family when he was preparing his guerrilla metal and preparing her lunch," said Luiss Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Taking into account everything that has gone wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond who was glory every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about what happened is called upon to call a SFPD hotline of 415-575-4444.
New physicians: call for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are demanding that their trade unions start protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The New Doctors Committee of the British Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to request the council to support broader protests at the beginning of September.
The JRC believes that the ministers have failed to address the Treaty.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract proposed by the LMA.
58% of all members who participated in the vote voted against the treaty.
In a letter published on the day of the day of the day on Twitter, Elana McMaizt, a member of the JAK Council, indicates that the government remains silent on this issue and the offer of the contract has therefore been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, because of the vote in the UK, the offer of the contract is completely rejected and decided to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JRC today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the development of new agreements to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including the suspension of work for the first time in NHS history.
Dr. Johana Malawana, the new spokesman for LMA, resigned after the vote was rejected by the House.
Before the meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had been told for members of BMA that the offer is good and will be adopted.
After the vote, the health secretary Jremijs Hant said the contract would be concluded with the medical medical profession in England.
Russia and Turkey: Open alliance?
He ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to marry and report on the end of the eight-month war and the end of economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin's leader in St Petersburg's St Petersburg, with the impression that this partnership is more needed for Ankara.
However, both were in trouble.
Vladimir Putin's smile appeared congested and did not cause warm emotions, even in view of his usual restraint.
On the other hand, Tajips Erdogan called Putin at least five times for his "dear friend" at least five times.
I felt a number of people.
He went on to say that "relations with Russia will not only improve to the level of pre-crisis but will become stronger."
Next day, one newspaper reported that Erdogan was behaving as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm is a source of controversy.
However, the radiation of Putina shows that the Russian leadership has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the cracking down of the Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin was accused of Ankara being inspired by a star in Moscow's back.
The distance was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
It will be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to restore true confidence.
Since November, Russia's public opinion has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed to have been the fault of the Turks.
The most serious was the charges that the family of Erdogan himself had profited from illegal oil trade with the Islamic part of the Islamic State.
He was, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of a peace settlement are obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends following the failed coup last month in which he tried to overthrow.
Also, countless terrorist attacks have shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused severe losses, in particular, the ban on charter flights, which usually make the influx of millions of Russian tourists into Turkish resort every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russia's shelters and charter companies are relieved when regular flights are restored.
They look forward to a holiday in the Mediterranean Sea.
Already this week, public TV is predicting a drop in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's fruit and vegetables imports will be renewed.
As I quote from the local newspaper Vedemosat: 'The tourists, tomatoes, we are in tomatoes'.
However, there were other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for the weak reaction to attempting a coup.
One can also look at the frustration of the protracted accession negotiations and the intervention of Putin, who are happy to take advantage of Turkey's alienation from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly won additional points in Ankara's eye in support of its elected government following the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow is well aware of this, as it is a deep-rooted fear of regime change.
The summit, which took place in this luxury boat, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as the analyst, the 'marginalised alliance' called, two countries that feel marginalised from the West to join forces.
However, despite public disunity, there are still considerable differences between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia is presenting itself as a medium of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations without wishing to disclose information, both Presidents stated at a press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey was resolutely avoiding questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries can find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of indiscriminate hostile relations and potential catastrophes, when a NATO member of a NATO member shook off a Russian combat plane, the situation has improved, as the two leaders have at least reopened negotiations.
Scottish Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The IOC will continue to play a role in the future, the Bank's Executive Director said.
Outside the Scottish SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McCann told the Scottish City of Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions at a global level.
It has abandoned these ambitions, since eight years ago, the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, expert behaviour experts have used the IRB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from the Seme to the Wimbldton Palace, to the Emdia tennis champion Endija Murey.
However, it has now been decided to bring forward other national brands.
The Scottish Royal Banac will be available to Scottish clients, but will not be instigated.
In England and Wales, all the IOC's references, outside the head office and the official stock exchange list, will be replaced by NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the brand The Ulster Bank is already in use.
The smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will also be taken into account.
The boat was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees along Invernesshire.
He said the BBC Scottish Canal's channel: 'The ICC will become our investors brand and with which our workers are working, because now we are becoming more than a brand bank'.
In time, the bank became a global brand and the ICC became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our staff will work with customers below those brands.
The IOC has already announced that there will be no sponsors of the Seven and will involve different brands in sponsorship.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?"
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and we would develop those brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focus on the needs of customers, not to our own needs, we have obviously achieved a great deal of change.
We can revive these brands again, so I think the time is right now.
Poky Dators wins a 3000th victory with the first seat in New Jersey with a horse Predilection
Describing the champagne of the champagne, fighting his 3000th victory twice in the first round of Newcastle in New Jersey.
"On Friday, the Castle David Davis won his 3000th victory in Britain's history with the first seat in New Jersey.
He achieved this by fighting the second victory in his home town, with the Predilection that John Goser exercises.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth chickey, who has reached the races of the results in the races of the results.
He is joined by Seram Gordonam Ričard, Dougam Smitam, Lestery Pigos, Peter Ederijs and Villiam Karsson.
"This is something special," he said, adding that "this is something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newcab because I have been here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Askota, but it is a normal night of Friday, together with 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detors and Predilection are expected with applause and with light.
Sir Antondy, who won the championship, has won more than 4300 win shots in the first half of the season, while Sir Anthony Mackow scored a number of entries.
Lesters Pigot, the nine-time winner, won the winner, winning 4 493 victories during his career.
The French are one of the best clicks of today, and it is no surprise that he has succeeded, which is the rare thing to achieve.
He is a friend and strong, but his tactics are separated by him from other clicks.
He is a fantastic spokesman, his enthusiasm and charter attracts the anger of this type of sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I said in French, in Epsoma, that he had already won 6 000 victories, if I would not take part in just the weekend and in the big race.
But, seriously, it is a real pleasure that the French have been regularly won in the UK for 30 years.
He is a lively who fits perfectly in the British race, and he is a great smell.
The Frenchman deportees noted this achievement with his company's brand, the airport's noble.
As a result of the finishing of wind to airstriking, the French desert has been a British horse face for twenty years.
This has been a beautiful path.
He has won countless big races, including the famous 1996 "Great Official of the 1996" Askota, and has survived the plane crash and disqualify the use of the preparations.
Three years ago he was difficult to return after six months' disqualification, but he has demonstrated his own strength, challenging those who questioned him when he returned to his best form.
And he could take another time for a while - the deportees have said in the past that they will be happy to continue their participation at least to 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismiss the head of administration, Sergei Ivanovs
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of administration, Sergei Ivanov, unexpectedly.
Ivanovs has been in the immediate circle of the nearest people for many years.
At the moment, a 60-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin's statement states that Putins "has decided to release Ivanovs from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reason."
Mr Antons Vaino, Vice-President since 2012.
Waino has been a diplomat for 44 years.
In 1972 he was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, both by prestigious Moscow National Relations Institute (MVSAI) and later worked on the Tokyo Embassy.
The Kremlin's homepage (Russian), later chaired the President's protocol and government staff management.
After his appointment he said: "Thank you for your confidence."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the State in drafting the laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanovs himself wanted to leave the office and recommended Waino as a substitute.
Is the smile convinced?
This step upset Moscow.
Sergei Ivanovs is a salt and close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he worked at the Soviet Security Service at the time.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a public television session, both men said Ivanovs resigned on his own initiative.
But, despite the chambers of the cameras, it is rarely convincing that such clarification is convincing, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows that.
However, the official statement that a man who was regarded as a potential president suddenly wanted to become a head of Russian environmental policy is suddenly being treated with a great deal of scepticism.
In the remarks published on the Kremlin on the Kremlin's website, Mr Ivanov says: 'It is a fact that, in early 2012, I ask you to entrust this difficult post, could even say problematic office, for four years.
It appears that I have been in office for four years and eight months.
Ivanovs took office in December 2011.
He had previously been Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service, like Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putins was chaired by Ivanov of the Federal Security Service, the successor of the KGB, of his deputy.
When Putin came to power he called Ivanovs for the five people who he had the most trust.
At the end of the second term, Ivanovs was considered to be a potential candidate for the Russian president, because the re-election of Putin to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
However, at that time, he became a pro-European member of Putina Medvedev - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to the office after three and a half years.
The appearance of cannabis fish in the city of Banfa
A man from Banfa is asking for help to find out what species have appeared in his garden in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sandware, who have travelled with water.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres from the sea, made the fish a video on Perisums, I hope someone could know how these 5 centimetres were caught in his garden.
The cross bond cross: the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
Currently, the €1.35 billion project is planned to be finalised in May 2017.
Engineering has connected the northern part and viaducta of the KWssel cross section, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of bridge is coming to an end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs between 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete concrete and 46 support cables.
At the moment, the 1.35 billion pound project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The economic secretary of Keits Brauns was today arriving at the construction site and was one of the first to embark on the bridge.
He said: 'This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of a bridge in the KWA.'
In this project, we see an insurmountable engineering solution where more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel are used in construction of this part.
Despite the huge size and size of the bridge, the bridging, bridges and viaducts, a process which requires huge precision is extremely delicate.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge is already constructed and the last phase will be set up, which will connect the bridge with Rositu today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for entry.
Michael Martin, the director of the fourth bridge project, said: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link is to demonstrate a class of terrestrial engineering.
After the last road section and connecting it with the support of the northern tower, we were postponed to connect the northern road with a section of land or viaducts.
This was done by putting 700 millimeters south on the eagerness of the northern state building.
It was a huge and, at the same time, highly sensitive operation.
It is a huge, because the viaducts is 222 meters long, weighs around 6 000 tonnes and had to spend around 3%.
The window, because the tolerance in both directions was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, things have worked well.
Simona Bailsa is acquiring gold for women.
There were lots of tension.
It is a surprise.
This is not a matter of concern for the hundreds of Bavars.
Dicnical scaremongering.
No effort shall be made to carry out the wedging on the beam.
You were not able to go down on the floor.
Absolutely not.
And finally, the Olympic Champions.
On Thursday, an American soldier won a gold medal at a 19-year-old, showing the difference between ourselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total points of this are 62,198 were the forensic court of the silver medal and the result of her team's tennis Alia Raismanes, and the result of the Mustakestal of the Russian athlete Away, the Russian athlete Away.
On Thursday, Simona Bailsa, the US athlete, conducted an exercise on the exercise of a beam sports exercise in the individual finalists of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bavars became the fourth American in a row that won a multi-battle champion and the fifth best guest champions, gradually enhancing the reputation as the best in history of his generation and perhaps the best talents.
When the final result was announced she was dispersed in tears, because the long road to this was at an end.
This achievement ranks them beside unbearable sportspeople like Maikles Felps, who lifted his sport at another level.
Bayern has been dominated in the past three years in the form of 15 medals of world championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling the same excellent, precise and ambitious exercise that the 1984 Olympic Championship, Mary Lu Reton,, was named "the best exercise that she has ever seen."
In Brazil, he was waiting for him the last test, where she had to compete to a great extent with the hopes that were made for him and not with the other athletes.
She would disappoint if he returned to his home in judgments in the Texas without gold medals.
Simona Bailsa and Alij Raismane, a US athlete, are surrounded by gold medals of gold medals of gold and silver medals respectively during the 2016 summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first golden medaler was won on Tuesday, making the special audience, Marta Karolji, in the champions.
Although Bailsa claims that in his long way, it did not have any expectations of this, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which includes her special actuarial transition, is accompanied by a Latvian music flowing on the streets in the face of the Rio Olympics.
It is no coincidence.
The girl, which was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still a baby man, was launched by the Eiman Body of the third country of Eimia on a sport in an excursion on a sport in which the layout of the Bye Park was born, now becoming a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in a battles since the summer of 2013 and a series of victories can continue as long as Bailsa wants it.
Although it was a little under leadership during the two rotation of Mustarea, it was only an illusion.
The beautiful beauty and the free movement - a part of the competition where Bailsa will stand up for his title - are still in front of us.
She took the lead with 15,433 on the beauty and strengthened leadership with the result of 15.933 free movement
Raismane was appalled by her while awaiting results that were merely a formality and that she was discharged into a fun in the face of the dream she had ever recorded in his remarks in his remarks.
Raismanes resulted in a slight reprisals for four years of events when she divided a third seat with Mustathe, but lost the bronze medale.
This time, a 22 year old team captain, which the Americans call a 'grandmother', came under convincing leadership.
After his performance in the free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she could devote her to an air kiss.
Meanwhile, on the top line of the 19 years of Bayse's top Twitter on Twitter, which she published this week, there is already a different meaning.
The 6 year old MahJuns was shot in the fire in Philadelphia.
The police news that a 6-year-old bird was shot in Filadelphia, saying it was the second six-year-old who was shot this week in Philadelphia.
A child parent CBS Philadelphia has confirmed that it is Mahajas Brauns.
Parents say Brauna was shot several times, including, in the circus, in the foot, in the hand and in the stomach, but there was still a consciousness when he was taken to hospital.
His grandmother, Deloresa Melendeza's story on television: 'His little body was simply a bull by the window'.
I could not believe that.
A boy in a critical condition has been placed in hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going in the first class in the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot by the town of Jermantaunas.
Three men were shot: two men aged 29 and one man aged 32.
Cancún's CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29 year-old men is in a critical condition, while the remaining two victims are stable.
Cancún said a child was found in front of the machinery in front of the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two were not in the ambulance and the police investigated whether any of them had been attacked.
CBS Philadelphia, a prosecutor, told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely to be involved in fire.
A weapon of cartridge found in a different weapons was found at the site.
It seems that it has been a long-standing shock.
Sulds found on both rooms of the pedestrians.
"So it appears that there have been several armed shooters who actively participated in the fire," the chief of the Philadelphia police captain Antonijs Ginux told reporters.
Also, several homes and cars have been taken out of the hall.
No one has yet been detained and the police is reporting the records of surveillance cameras.
At the time of the shooting, a girl was shot dead by a girl of 6 years old while she was married in front of his home in the district of Vestouklein.
She is slowly recovering, but the police still search for the perpetrator.
Why do we need Simona, Gaby and Lauria?
I call this a year for the Women's Olympics Wieglatlated Komanda.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three easy Latvians, Simona Bailsa, Gabija Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza, which inspire many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that this team is part of the Alliance Alija Raismane, who is a Jewish and Medisona Kociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of the black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
The last four years of the last four years are the Americans of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabija were held 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabija Duglasa became hasty as the Olympic champions, and America could love.
The world has now seen incredible exercise by the triple world champion Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza, in unprecedented but masterious terms.
Simona became the fourth American in a row on Thursday, which has won the gold medale of individual women.
Her Holja Raismane won the silver medaler.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different.
Simona, Gaby and Lauria entered the Olympic read, like the Alliance and Medispon.
They are the 'Olympic Four' because the next Olympic exercise in the team will be four athletes, and this is the final year of the third year of the third year of the third year of the third year of the third year in the work of the third place.
In fact, the exercise is expensive sport; the perpetrators are mainly trapped in private light clubs, and they are kept by parents who pay for training for trainers, premises, trips, poaches, hotels, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenditure.
Most of these small clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, sportsmen's athletes take all their coaches, and this is a costly and long investment for easy families.
Eimija Brighman, the Simpton coach and Megija Hainia, has trained his athletes since two girls started to deal with their athletes since two girls began to deal with their athletes.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by the Simona, Gabya and Lauria, the cheaper exercise of exercise.
I established my easy eagerness organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is in Hard, and we offer more than 15 000 young people (mainly black and Spanish) to install free or at low cost, but we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be opening a branch in Detroit (my home city) to give local young people the opportunity to familiarise themselves with this excellent sport.
Greater development of force, slope and body coordination, as well as hard work, discipline and ambition.
The combination ensures a life of good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in easy eagles and it is fantastic.
It is very important, especially for young girls, to deal with this type of sport.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you, Mr Simona, the Alliance, Gabija and Medisland, for the excellent demonstration of the Mevia in which the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivate countless young girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jos Hanta's offer, the new doctors intend to go further.
Ministers looked forward to an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on a treaty change with representatives of the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Mr Hant announced plans to conclude a treaty, saying that NHS is in an unstable state and further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new treaty, which provides for a change in the conditions of night work and weekend in order to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Dr. Eengna Makourta, the new commissioner of the BMA evening, said that the new doctors still had serious concerns about the proposed treaty, especially that it would deepen the labour crisis and did not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
There have been eight weeks until the first group of new doctors signed the new treaty, so progress needs to be made, because time has not remained much.
The BMA attempts to solve the problem have met with the unwillingness of the government to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This despite the fact that last month, Jos Hant said that his door was always open.
He has to take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with the new physicians.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13 000 rutine operations were postponed and 100 000 visits were made, while the nurses and consultants attempted to replace the doctors who had fled in the room.
Ministers looked forward to an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on a treaty change with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate by the weekend of 54 000 new doctors to be covered by new contracts.
NHS employment CEO Daniels Mortimers called for new treatments not to take industrial action.
Mr Mortimera makes clear that strikes do not solve anything, but only raise pressure on busy workers and worry, create stress and delay patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been talking to the new doctor committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and the other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about the providers and the rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as the deployment of workers, flexible training, additional training for returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, the abandonment of studies and gender pay gap in medical terms, shows that employers, the health education institutions of England and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
A 2 pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attacks.
Thousands of patients who have been in heart for their hearts could be treated with a maximum of 2 pounds per day, as the official representatives recommend they use more people and take longer periods.
Ticagrelor Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a recurrent critic for people with comfort.
These medicines are already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart of layer, reducing the risk of repetition.
In the recitals of NHS, NICE reacted to use this preparation for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and cardiovascular problems to people with cardiovascular problems.
However, for the moment, retaliation by NHS under the responsibility of NHS is 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular.
Every year, around 140 000 people in England are suffering a heart of heart and a quarter of them are going through a rehearts or insult.
A heart and insult are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart of the heart of frames.
If the dam burst, it can create a thromba by blocking blood to the heart of the blood and causing a heart of heart.
However, if the thrombs are separated from blood-borne walls, it can get further in the bloodshed and block blood access for brain brain.
People who have been a heart of hearts are subject to greater risks of repetition.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca and traded under Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombin.
The new NICE guidelines, which were published today, recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months and another 3 years from 60 mg twice with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsson, director of the health technology of the NICE health technology, explains: 'In spite of the fact that there are more than a quarter of people who have been a heart of heart, more than a quarter of those who have been in heart are going through another villages or insult, which are often hard hit'.
Fears from a recurrent heart can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that, in combination with Ticagrelor combined with aspirin, the risk of repetition is effectively reduced by the risk of a repeat laster and arctic for people who have already experienced it.
We are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options for thousands of people who are benefitting from the treatment of Ticagrelor.
In view of the limited information on the efficiency and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding, using this medicinal product for longer than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used for longer than that date.
Politkov-centre culture promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurs Rahman, former mayor of the former people of the West Bank, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government's report reveals that the culture of political correctness has turned a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister, Sir Oettinger, criticized the police, electoral monitors and city councils, that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "fear is being taken to violate ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of community, who has now become head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so prevalent that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at election stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present a person's identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Only the word and the address must be given to voters.
He even recommends that special wealthy voices be earmarked for vote, in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs also need to ensure greater protection, says Sir Event.
He believes that the press should have more access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with that'.
The report was commissioned by Dauningstrtes after the scandal in connection with the elections in the town of Tauerhamleta.
Last year, the special election court decided to cancel the mayor of mayor of the mayor of Lutfuru Rahman from the mayor of the town.
The Court found that Rahman "was cynically manipulated by religious beliefs of his Muslim community and concealed its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the impression that religious Muslims' religious duty is to vote for him."
Around 300 were falsified or questionable, as one person had voted several times.
Sir Ers also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He said that it is particularly worrying that the voting order by senior members of the Muslim community forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Build suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a person's identity document in order to clarify the identity of the person.
His report says: 'Evidence shows that vulnerable ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the oldest candidates chosen by communities, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistani communities. "
"There are concerns that the authorities in the area are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness because of ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Build set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to operate with mail surpluses in order to prevent "votes."
The report, which is being examined by Terse Meja, also calls for a more thorough registration of registrations to prevent the use of electoral rolls in the area of immigration and benefits.

Reinforce training so that people's staff can ensure that voters move on to the elections.
Sir Oettinger is strongly critical of the Metropoles police without compromising that no charges have been made in the case of the Tauerhamta case.
He tells us: "The Election Court only disqualated Lufturu Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was firmly found guilty of a standard criminal evidence standard on the basis of abundant evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient urban council's "discerning" of voter turnout at voters' polls.
Sir Oettinger says: "The court decision adopted last year is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of the institutions that fraud does not jeopardise this good reputation.

Anirona Makdone Analysis of 14 years old Ai Yanhas finiu fourth place 4x200 m free glass station for women, summoned a storm of indignation at CBC audiences.
The Canadian Canadian's CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese blow was "flying off the competition" and "ended like pigs."
He said his microphone had been switched off when 4x200 m for women had set out his personal opinion at the end of the finalists.
He said that the CBC, which was included in the CBC team's comment to give his comments, "is not capable of keeping a fourteenth year of China."
"I've gone too far, she got out of the competition that I was n't a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result was 1: 57.79 seconds in the second phase of the 14-year old cabinet, Ai Yanhana, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian theatre Ruck, enabling the Canadians to catch up with China.
The viewers across Canada immediately reacted via the internet because it was shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emeta Macfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Whether direct CBC's comment has just said that 14 years of Chinese swimming went like pig?????????????????????????????
Idiota did not realise that they were still in direct eating.
Ai Yanha, from China 4x200m for the free glass finals, was named "a young teenager from China who does not hold there."
The criticism against Baironu Macdonalde was passed quickly, as many asked for explanations.
Users were unable to believe by hearing the insensitive comments made by Bairona Makdone.
Follow Sir Paradi on Twitter: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You are representative of CBC and Canada and, for the sake of you, we all sound like racist.
Shortly after that, the Scottish who chaired the CBC live at the time apologised for the comments made by McCann, saying: "We apologise for having a comment on the result of the swimming."
That was the unfortunate choice of words, and we are very sorry that this happened.
The CBC apologised for more than 90 people who had reacted to Twitter.
He had to apologise for his role in his role.
Then CBC had an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained of a comment by Macdonalda.
The channel also published the apology and the statement quickly.
We very much regret that such comments were made and came to the direct table.
Yesterday we responded immediately and apologise to all the live viewers and the followers in the social media.
For the sake of clarity, the comments made by Bairona were made about the bathers' performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were, in any case, unprofessional and unfortunate expressions and Bairons.
He was personally apologised by the person in front of the day and attempted to explain that he did not think that his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
He said in a live broadcast broadcast at the Olympic Games: "I would like to use a moment and apologise for the comment made yesterday following the free style of women."
I am talking about the bathers' performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect and I really regret that.
The buyers are shocked by a woman who is unshamelessly in the middle of the beautiful class.
It was uncomfortable when a woman started to blow to the neck to keep the fingers in the middle.
By further aggravating the situation, she stopped them in order to see if they had been standing and then trapped by putting them back on the shelf.
She continued to look for the garment at the Folkeston Bouverie Place in the store shop of the marketing centre and the other four fingers.
Pristk's Bouverie Place trade centre in Folkeston, a place where the woman ran the subal and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, John Deividsson, a mother of two children, who tells us that the unknown woman was pulling his clothes after the suburb's bedroom, left his clothes and left the shop.
She pointed out that people were unable to believe their eyes.
She walked out in the middle of the hall, walking his thoughts from my thoughts, pulling his beard and trouble and wearing it on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, they just stopped them on the spot.
Everyone looked like a girl and apparently the woman did not like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She waited three fingers until she decided that she was not like any of them and abandoned the shop.
It did not seem that he would worry that somebody looks at or advises about the man who bought the clothes that she is going through.
Davidsson, 33 from Kenya, said: "It was the idea that somebody bought clothes who had been beaten by another man and who had not been washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Deich, in a nutshell, said: 'I assume that the staff of the performing workers took away these clothes from the bridge - which is also acceptable,'.
I could not imagine that you could buy a new subveat and learn that they had taken them and then they had been washed out.
He said that Pristk was aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August.
Concrete clothes have been removed from the circle.
How to protect ourselves from firearms by means of Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
We talked with Krav Maga's great master from New York Ronu Mizraki in order to find out how to protect yourself.
Whether you attack you from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win the upper.
Mizgeria says that if the aggressor is attacked from the back, then the first step must be taken to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory.
Then the weapon must be made between his front hand and the shoulder and the side of the opponent with his free elite.
Then follow a glass with the knee, and while the aggressor smell in the bag, the weapon must be taken away, you must walk on the face of the weapon and must step aside by continuing to take the weapon against him.
If the aggressor is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from a shot trajectory, a weapon must be set and the evil must be destroyed in such a way that the bad cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and take a blow to the opponent of the opponent and finally withdraw him from his weapon and resign on him.
Is it difficult?
You see video to see exactly how it is doing this in Mizraka.
But remember if you don't be the master of Krav Maga, it is safer to give the robber of his money.
The Wandal family is being demolished by Saltata Cornvola's social house and is being placed in the street.
The German family has been disposed of as a place of terror to terrorise a neighbouring country by damaging the social housing of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Šon Trebilkok were shot out of a property in the Cornsala, because they had a number of complaints about them.
When they had been forcibly removed from property, the shocking representatives of the Housing Service found that property was completely scandalous.
There were holes in the rings and the walls and the walls had been washed everywhere and the walls were in the graffiti.
The family is now out of property and is likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, the manager of the Cornolo Housing Service, says that there is a fear that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She tells us that people who lived here were extremely difficult and she thought that people could not live.
A number of factors need to be assessed in this case, since in future this property will have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their word is well known.
The rest was three sons who had periodically been in possession and the police said that their terror had been expressed as violence, arrogance on the street with the beautiful clubs, intimidation of the local population, drug use, drug trafficking and beautiful beaches.
The 42-year-old Skeldonor, whose name was property, was sentenced in June to punish antisocial behaviour.
Waste found to be displayed in several exciting homes.
In a home where drugs can previously be marketed, there are also a number of floodplains which have been dispersed.
Neighbours say they are regularly on the streets and are constantly called by the police.
The home office of the Cornen Housing was forced out by them from property forcibly after they had been given 11 weeks from house to get out voluntarily.
The desperate neighbours were very happy about eviction, because their life has been an absolute one.
One said: 'They did not care the other people'.
We lived behind them for 20 years, it is always crazy.
It is unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
This morning I was unable to sleep.
We wake up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!
Now that they are finally away, it will be wonderful.
An MEP who is a head of the Cornvoln Housing Service, said that the family did not work with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police has been regularly called here.
Various old articles were found in the overcrowded garden.
He also said: "It is a great pity that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because eviction is always the last step in the Cornvola Housing Service."
This was a very complex case, because their behaviour was extreme and it was very hard for neighbours to look after their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that has been put into this in this case by the police and comfort members of my entire team, the Devon and Kornvola police, who were courageous and collaborated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbouring countries and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpattcher said that all three sons had lived in different time periods, but all were around 20 years old.
A dirty mattress that remains on the floor in one of the room after eviction.
The staff of the service will now have to set up a waste blended in the home.
In 2014, the police carried out searches and found more than 70 grams of marijhuana, weight, accessories and 1 700 pounds in clear cash.
It is only found guilty of class B in the storage of drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lord Shelledon who died in the car accident in 2013.
After the pretence, they now know that they are renting a private property in Plimute at the moment.
Many of the walls were shot in the graffiti.
The police claim that they will continue to evict the tenants of their rental agreements.
"This eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules."
She also said: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave like they want and will have no consequences."
Police and anti-social behaviour are not acceptable to the police and the police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Greater spending can give a boost to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes was banned by carrot swimming on beaches.
The mayor of Cannes in France's southern city of Cannes has banned the wearing of the city's beaches, which almost completely absorbed the women's body's body and is very reminiscent of the hydrotera, local officials said on Thursday.
Cannes Mayor Linara has announced that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who has no ash collection, respect for good customs and secularism as a basic principle of the French Republic."
"The misgivings of religious affiliations at a time when France and cult places are the target of terrorist attacks can create a risk of interference by public order (grooming, collision, etc.) which is necessary to prevent it," he said.
"We are not talking about a ban on the wearing of religious symbols on the beach, but about the external clothes associated with the trust in the terrorist movements that are war with us," he said.
He said that the carrot swimming was not seen in Cannes's beaches since July 28, when the Republican Party's Republican Party, Linster, signed the order and entered into force.
In the city of Marseille this week, a planned private event was lifted in the city of Marseille, who would be wearing a bread in the swimming of the swimming swimming swimming in the city of Marseille because it was indignant for the right and the left-wing politicians.

On 26 July, two attackers were brutally murdered by a church in a church in north-west France.

In Lucavsalon, the festival was launched by "Cuba."
On Thursday 11 August, in Lucavsalon, one of the last festivals of this summer was launched "Cuba."
In the first round, groups like Enter Shikari from Great Britain, who were expected last year, did not disappear from the programme, the NOFX, DJ Maxim from the Prodigy and others.
Also in the next festival, the programme is notable words: Guano Apes and Garbage, winning a champion, Marky Ramone's BlitzRussig, Brutto & Lyapis, a popular champion leader, Sergei Mihaloks, who won the prize. Wikabgs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a series of other but a full programme of measures can be considered here.
This is the second year that the Kubana festival is taking place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it was not stopped by the organisers from repeated attempts - they added to the name, a Latvian group was added to the name (19: 15 in late Friday) and said that the festival has now become "nearby and acquired a local flask alongside Riga symbols like its panorama and cats."
Whether the festival is only sketched out is too early, but as the Delfi Eclab was watching on the first evening, at least a huge number of people have not yet been caught in the year and the number of visitors was similar to that of last year.
The British Castle Team was twice as good as the record of the Olympic record and the skin.
A British team on Thursday twice corrected the Olympic record and won a match for men.
The first Olympic record was corrected in the first round of the season, while the first round of the season had been reshuffled from the first round of the season.
The British team with New Zealand was taken on board by a British team with the help of a silver medallist, leaving them with silver medals.
The British team won 42.440 seconds, with an outbreak of 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for a bronze, the French team was overshadowed by Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the practice of female travel for women - the British team has corrected the world record, which is now 4: 13.260.
The President who remained in the shadow: Gustavam Pegale, 145.
On Friday 12 August, the second Latvian President, Gustav Zemgale, was born.
The country was proclaimed by the Latvian state, but it is uncomfortable that the first Latvian president should be named in the shadow of the last president of Chaksa and the former President of the United Kingdom.
No one of our statesmen has so much championed democracy and the rule of law as a Earth, a book issued by Arnolds Auzins in a book devoted to Gustavina Pegalo 10 years ago.
Speaking to the Delfi portal, Auzins said that Earth is one of the few senior politicians who had a humiliating sense.
Others are stubbornly right.
He taught that at all, it could be like that of Raimonds Vejonis today.
"He was one who is close to the people," he said.
Today's politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to the Carli Ulman as a good leader, but rarely know how bad he was.
The only person to whom he was absent was the only person in government meetings was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind in the bills he was kind and smile, he was hysterical.
"The bottom with his humour and democracy leaves exactly the opposite impression," he said.
Professor Aivars Stranga, Faculty of the University of Latvia, and Professor Aivars Stranga, of the University of Latvia, agree with the "Delfi" assessment of the Earth as a calm and wealthy statesman.
He also notes that the Pegale has displayed respect for minorities, has regularly called on the representatives of Jews to the president.
"At the time, it was not normal, after the Pest Presidency, Alberts Kviesis, took this tradition," the historian said.
He was a silent man who had long had to become President for a long time.
He did not want it, just like it was.
He also quite critically assessed himself because he was not aware of the French, but he thought the President had to understand.
"During the Presidency, the French foundations were taught," explains Stranga.
The farmer did not dare to speak again to stand; he did not like it in any way.
In any case, he is a very dignified figure in the history of Latvia, before being held in a serious position before the President was in office.
The Pegale was also headed by the famous Pegalrova Street Street in the streets of the Street Street, 3, which was a member of the Latvian state in a practical way in negotiations between the government and the Latvian state.
He was very forward-looking.
There was not a great man of Ulmay, but he was not in public either.
"In private talks, it has sometimes been said that he did not simulate the true Ulmaslis's activities," he said.
There are peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How do the Earth remember today?
That is a pity, but a large part of him associates with one street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, thought was centre-right.
"There was no big upheaval in his time: he could be associated with a real stable presidency," he said.
A visit by a Latvian country from 1927 to 1930 was also attended by a visit by a Latvian state visit to Sweden, which had implicitly contributed to full recognition of the neighbouring country and its inclusion in the democratic family of northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, the Pegale was visiting a country visiting a country in Stockholm.
A visit by Swedish King Gustav to Latvia was held on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871, while in January 1939 he was in January 1939.
Simple ways of helping a child deal with anger lenses.
I am often confronted with the fact that the anger of a child, the occurrence of a parent, is regarded as something wrong and absent parents.
When a child executes his anger, we do not know how to react, "Econet," said psychoe Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist is urging a small negotiation of these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that each face periodically each.
Agrey - it is already a physical activity addressed to another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, disturbed, we usually know what is happening with us and how to deal with it.
We can give our anger and our anger: to say, to suppress, to conceal, to keep in on, to tell your friends or to other loved ones, we can apply a sofa to your friends or to other loved ones - that is not the best way to disperse anger!), to go down the empty, to be caught by the front and to do other things that are not usually done.
We do not treat our aggression against others, because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when looking for anger, do not understand what is happening to them, how they are to be called and how they live with them.
They can say: 'Ej leave!', you're a fool, 'Sush mamma', 'I do not see you,' 'I do not dare with you' - and very rarely when you can say 'I am angry you'.
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely here, at this point in time, they are spontaneous and indeed in the appearance of their feelings, and often in various emotions.
It is very important that parents should not be banned from taking feelings, including anger, for a child, and do not have to do so, but on the contrary to help the child.
Is it necessary for relations to be restored?
A day's working day on which everything has not gone as you would like, or simply bad mood, are so many reasons why I would like to be off for a moment, a day or even longer from the whole world.
Is it possible for the relationship to be closed for a moment and a little bit?
Or, however, does it show that each of the partners is able to take their way?
I share my views on the different ages.
In my view, "in my view, if the relationship needs a guide, you don't be with the right people."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has revealed a scheme that may help anybody.
If you feel that the partner starts to fall on the nerves of every small detail, then it is the right moment to study other hunting fields to see whether you lack him or not, or not, in particular, to see him no longer.
So the answer is: yes, the withholding can help save time and understand how important you have the other half.
Kaspars (29) reveal their theory.
In my opinion, the relationship needs to be restored in every other day, because if you spend time with a man 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the controversy is inevitable.
It is because I am going to give every detail that the second is doing, and it is starting to fall.
People are starting to be sick of each other, especially if they are not even longer to talk about what you have done in the day.
My personal experience leads me to think, so I have not passed any relationship for more than a few months.
If you think at some point that it is better, or on others, to be better, then why do this woman, with whom you are, deserve one who can think that it is not good enough and have a paradise field behind the mountains?
It is already a small treason.
If not, it is not.
"I have, therefore, a little to condemn those who are not."
The man is almost entirely the opposite.
It seems to me that everyone needs a splendid time.
You wouldn't be any moments, all the time, from the morning to yesterday, to see each other in the eye and sticking about the impoverished love.
About!
There are so many things - friends, work, balloons.
Everything has its own time.
Of course, a friend or wife, but if both can keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
It is true.
Martin SCHULZ (DE), leader of the EPP-ED group said: "It is hard to say, what needs to be said, what needs to be said, or not to take the pains, but one thing is certain: something is missing in relations until the end, something lacking."
If this question is raised, then it is worth noting that there will be any changes in the near future - to the good or the bad side, that depends on ourselves.
I think that, while you are still a new and delicate, it is necessary, at the same time, for us to take the necessary - even for all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You are deciding, however, to spend all your life together.
"If you cannot tolerate one another from each other and we need to be an occasional crude once again, then what will happen when you are retired by pensioners who comment on how the garden cats or disputes about which day the garden is better worded," explains Kristaps (19).
All of Mr words have been changed.
With his enthusiasm and enthusiasm, Rozental wrote the best interest of the Latvians on the Orange Arts.

Kolegova points out that the debate on her candidacy has increased the controversy between the ruling coalition parties.

"This is not acceptable to me either," said the head of the Revenue Service's head.
In the event that her candidature were confirmed in government, it would be clear that this would not be a credible vote and would not allow for the proper work and the necessary changes to the Revenue Service, with the full support of the whole government.
It would not be possible without it, Kolegova.
"On a number of occasions I have publicly emphasised that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at this moment all my candidacy is too politicised," the official said.
"Thank you for the trust and support you have shown," he said, adding Kolegova of the Reiznie-Ozot article.

The Riga Free Ports Authority has introduced all of the five National Control (Audit) recommendations on the development of the project infrastructure project to the transfer of activities from the city centre to the Russian port, and will be informed by the company on its company.
Approval of the project is planned at the near session of the Board of Governors of Riga.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in line with the opinion of the UC, the documentation required for the documentation required for the implementation of the recommendations was also followed by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit of the legal and operational audit carried out by the International Auditor Deloitte Riga to improve the project's management in the forthcoming phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent out today.
Despite the fact that the Riga free port of Riga does not agree with the opinion drawn up by the Office on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the project's implementation and the donor, the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction works planned under the project have been fully completed within the prescribed deadlines and planned levels.
"In order to prove all those involved in the project, including the EC, the K and also the Relavers, that the main objective of the free port is to implement the project successfully, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UC for the management and monitoring of the project," said Sanita Caire, the head of the Russian island project.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was supplemented with the main planned actions of the parties concerned and the timing of the decisions required, the definition of meetings and regular reporting and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process as well as the definition of key points at the border points.

However, in order to improve control of the use of financial resources, it will be more appropriate to justify the need for a service contract or the opening of procurement in future, and the rule of law.
As part of the project, port infrastructure is built on the Russian island, four new deep sea adds, railway notes and civil engineering communication.
The structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into service at the end of the last year, with an estimated savings of EUR 10.6 million in funding.

German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the 'Berlin Wall'.
According to new studies, the number of fatalities at the communist yoke could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data passed on Wednesday to the Berlin Wall Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with the West's allies, 1 841 people were murdered by the Communist authorities of West Germany, trying to escape from their territory.
The border with border deaths has been studied for years, and the number of victims is corrected at a time.
A further 11 fatalities were added this year, including among the victims of a six-year-old boy who drowned in an attempt to reach West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet detoners of the Soviet army.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double evil of Communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said Alexander Hinsigte, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in trying to escape from a country controlled by the communist state are not lost and disappeared," he said.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"A figure of 1841 is unconvincing," said Beren Sen, an expert in the history of the Berlin Free University, in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, together with other researchers in the Free University of the Free University, is currently reviewing the alleged deaths at the border, and until now, only 260 cases have been approved.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by Communists near the Wall of Berlin.
In view of those who have died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the West through neighbouring countries, according to this, the number of victims could be around a thousand.
However, it is still far less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the varying number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all the suicide border guards of East Germany, whether directly linked to their service.
The museum shall also be listed in cases of death other than direct violence.
"If the angry between 70 and 80 years old, after a break with border control, died in a heart of heart," Houbrante said that the "murderous border" was the consequence of this "murderous border."
However, it is clear that the old people, who may have died as a result of their escapes, and those who died due to a long wait during the war at the border at the border, must be separated.
Regardless of its list of victims, it is not easy because the Communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistical data, and the researchers should be expelled from different archives in different archives, Sir says.
However, the Shata Group has recently given new documents and it could therefore be expected to present new casualties in the near future.
The LPF President, Pone, in Rio, with a coach accreditation, is a surprise myself.
In recent days, Kaspars Pone, President of the Latvian Federation of Indigenous Planning (LPF), celebrated at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, was born with a coach accreditation, but was very surprised by this.
On Wednesday, German Ribakovs coach Germans Jakubovska, a boat from Al Ribakou, who said that he had decided to go to Pone at the end of the last few days, had to go home.
The list was originally approved by bathers in Ayona Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins, coach Jakubovskis and Deivs Colas, as well as by the President of the Federation, Pone.
Five participants were told at the Olympic Games for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure of Aldons Vrublevskis, Germans said that Germans would and is being searched for tickets.
"But evidently for objective reasons he was not", "he said, adding that it did not affect the result of the Ribakou.
After the federation's request, Uzja coach had helped him to help.
Pone, who is himself a member of the executive board of the LOC, strongly criticised the role of the BC, leading to the blame for the organisation of the monitoring of Olympic sports.
As I see it, it is unethical to endorse five of the members of the LOK Executive Committee and not to remove one of them.
"I do n't know why it was precisely the federation of Pelza that did not have a place," Pone said in a public opinion that the federation and the presidents of the federations were not assessing the work of the federation and their presidents, recalling that the presidents of the federations did not pay the wages.
He also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakov was not approved between members, he complained to the International Federation of Water Sport (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes to any other.
He could not tell why he was in the Olympic Games with a coach accreditation, which was likely to be due to Jakubovsky.
"I have been presented as the president of the federation (" team leader "), but for reasons that have been uncertain for reasons, and now do n't get anywhere in it," he said.
The situation changed every day, the number of accredited accreditation changes changed.
Up to the last minute, I think German will be, because I did not have another information.
According to the information at the agency's disposal, a couple of days before the Ribakou started, she had a conversation with Poni on a couple of days and had to face tears after the bathwater, but the President himself said it was commonplace with a desire for athletes before starting.
Pone recalled that the LPF oversaw five types of sport that are in the Olympic Programme and four of them are also in Latvia's training.
He said that in Latvia it was also very important to have drowning issues and he talked about such programmes, while he had been in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the federation's work and said that Latvia could face World Cup in 2018.
Being in Rio is not my leave, I spent my time, I spent my time and I try to realise the four years of programmes.

Each year, scientific scientifically justified species and quantities in Daugava and in the water bodies of its basin take place in juveniles of juvenile fish and larlars.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its Basin water bodies, in accordance with the legislation, is carried out by Body, on the basis of an assessment of the damage to fish resources caused by Latvia's energetic economic activity, and a conclusion on which compensatory measures are to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
The National Environmental Service, on the basis of the expertise, shall decide on the amount and nature of the compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for recovery in the recovery programme for fishery resources is EUR 1 035 000.

The French court rejects the requirement to dismantle shops in the 'Jungle' refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request by the authorities to demolish tens of self-constructed shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees are living.
In a court meeting this week in Calais, the authorities pointed out that the state would have to demolish 72, where people sell different products in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, to offer a haircut service, 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some of the euro in restaurant restaurants.
In Calais, the Prefect Office pointed out that these self-established companies should be demolished because they make up the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as causing risks of fire and sanitation.
According to the members of the humanitarian group, these small businesses are essential because the governments and the supporters of the groups do not ensure that the camps are in place, where the number of residents is continuing to rise.
They also pointed out that self-locked shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those most in need.
The Court ruled that there is no legal basis for the expulsion of people who have made 72 stores, but it understands the prefecture of Calais.
Judge Franz Franla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food for people who live in an extremely uncertain environment.
He said that these places were peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French, and gives advice on asylum to hundreds of unaccompanied minors without adults.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of children's cafés.

In the midst of the first half of the season, Bom had a defeat in the first half of the season, while Bom had a defeat in the first half of the season.
In any case, Fiji is currently in its best form for 15 men to win.
Although it is unlikely, however, a certain comfort for Britain could be the fact that at least one brother won gold medals, which is Fiji's coach Ben Rage, a former England coach from Vimbldona.
Britain was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Athens, they lost all the games during the reguting section of 7 series in Adeoke.
They lost just one game this time.
The scaremongering is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji was impressed by the match, revitalising British forces of power.
Captain Tomam Michler and the members of the World History Square, Kucinskis, and the members of the World History, Tomam Michler, were in the lead with 5: 0 when Osea Kolinisau scored the first blow.
In the last four minutes, Jerny Tuwai also further increased the predominance of landing on the right wing.
The result 12: 0 and the British team had not even really touched on a bomb.
He did not let Leoni Nakaravs get three points, but it had only a slight effect on Fiji's result.
Jasa Veremalans made a landing in the seventh minute of the seventh minute in the seventh minute in a steep corner of the United Kingdom to 17: 0.
After the victory, the Nakarache further increased the predominance and had left more than a minute of the end of the first half.
Mr Ravouvou has avoided some of the misguided practices of the British force and crossed the line by taking points.
Contribution provided a result 29: 0.
Fiji was born in order to play regut 7, while the British were still learning.
In fact, it is true.
The British team had a major change in half a minute by breaking the Fiji's line... full four minutes that were good for the first half of the season, while Janshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team matching, scored a few more points in Fiji's favour.
Denam Nortonis managed to win the British team on the left-leaning corner with 36: 7, while the game had lost to 36: 7, while the Southern Sea salt fans had taken the flags, wasted flags and burst in the pockets.
There can be no admirable treatment of the life of Fiji's life.
Mata Viliame made the victory of Fiji even more susceptible to another at the end of the game.
Fiji could start to celebrate in Fiji after losing the game, but the British was unable to sit down after defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji conducted Japan with a result 20: 5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where the teams were in a very fierce struggle and the South hauliers lost a few points.
In the first half, Kail Brauns led the way in the second half, but in the second half, Den Nortons crossed the line in the second half and took the ball between the two rounds.
Anthony Grsson, who is an Anthony 15 player in England, won the great force at the end of the game and has won another silver medal at the end of the game.
The leader's fight against cancer was inspired by a shortfall by Helena Glover and Heteri Stancia.
It will be the most emotional gold medale in these benches, and it is already a great deal.
Between the first to the layout of the wall, the Helena Glole and Heteres Staningas's gold died of particular importance was played by the Estacio da Laga.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they spent a Robin Vilama echor, which inspired them, up to the second Olympic gold medale, to take the pair of pair to women by becoming the first women in the British history of sport, who have achieved such success.
They were undoubtedly dominated by them because, at the time, they won an unbearable, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes, with the bed of the bed, drowned by water surface, do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each of the gold medals of the gold, there is a whole team that is hard working to make sportspeople continually improve their performance and make a major contribution to their success by a coach who did not know 30 months ago if he was going to survive because he was found a cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as fast as it did.
I had the wind of urinous cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and that happened.
If it did not, it would spread along the whole body.
And the situation would be uncontrollable.
This slightly changes the vision of tags.
The cancer was opened in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that it was possible to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intermediate season, and to reduce the length of the break to a minimum, if this could be said.
I had to make the income, so I had to recover quickly.
This encouraged the recovery.
I was in hospital and I walked between 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, even though the doctor said that some steps would be enough.
That is what started.
Airport is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After victory, the first thought was straight about Vilams, who was very disturbed by all of this morning and was spoken more than usual in the worries.
Mr Stanking, who had been in Afghanistan in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional week, but that means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much this is for us and how much I have worked, Helena and Robin.
With 3 years of Helena and Robin, it has been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so many thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better coach or a better coach.
In five years, the Helena Glover and Hetere Standing have not lost.
There is such a huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to come closer, Staninga and Glowait were too high.
We felt every moment.
The shell was shouted: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is indeed important not to lose concentration.
We succeeded well, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day we did not have the intention to overthrow the record, but simply to fly and win the races and we did so.
A couple of years will rest in order to decide what to do next.
The next month will be Strat Bashala of Glover and television adultery.
For the moment, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last race.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London, I took about six months to understand that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it was about four minutes.
She said: 'It is a fantastic fantastic'.
A unique opportunity to look at the fantastic architectures of the Los Angeles Central Bibrotal Building.

The head of the Revenue Service, the head of the Revenue Service, will be at the head of the Revenue Service.
According to him, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens / Farmers) and Finance Minister Danai ReizniePropat-Ozolai (Greens / Farmers) are already "important" for the head of Finance Minister Kolegova to be appointed as head of the State Revenue Service.
Rajevskis estimates that the endorsement by the head of the Revenue Service in this government of Kucinskis and Reiznie-Ozolai is' the first big decision ', which may affect their future as politicians.
If the choice of a candidate for the head of the Revenue Service is to be changed now, this will have a negative impact on their national immunisation.
On the agenda of the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers next week, the issue of the relocation of DVD head Kolegova to the post of Director General of the Revenue Service is the result of the government's agenda.
Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola, head of the Revenue Service's head on the Revenue Service's head, was driven by the head of the Revenue Service's head, Reizniece-Ozola, after the resignation of Inara Petersone and a contest for the Revenue Service's Director General ended without a result.
Dace Peleka, a member of the Revenue Service's chief, admitted on Thursday, 11 August, in an interview with Latvian Radio, she could agree to a driver.
The Finance Minister later admitted that other candidates for the Revenue Service's position had not yet been selected.
Raivis Dzintars, head of Saeima of National Association, has also admitted that the party is still supporting Kolegoins under the leadership of the Revenue Service.
In Spain, the potential for reducing the budget deficit is jeopardised by the failure to establish a government.
A month ago, the European Commission issued an opinion on 12 July that Spain and Portugal did not take sufficient measures to reduce the deficit level to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
Estimates show that, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4. 4% of GDP and 5. 1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons that the EC did not impose sanctions against those two countries is the growing euroscepticism in many of the countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiments.
The critics say that the EC decisions are inconsistent in their decisions on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the Bundesbank, the German Bundesbank, pointed out that Europe would lose confidence in it by giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are realistic and not binding.
The EC has now proposed, and all Member States have approved, the extension of the deficit deadline until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to impose additional savings measures in addition to the circumstances.
The initial forecasts show that the target set by Portugal could be achieved by the agreed deadline and that the budget deficit could be reduced to 2. 5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, as part of the stability programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this annual budget, with additional attention to the cost of the procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4. 6% this year, 3. 1% next year and 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, over the next two years, consolidation measures must be set at 0. 5% of GDP per year.
In particular, it makes the achievement of these objectives difficult to ensure that the Spanish political parties have not managed to agree on the formation of a government for eight months, and it is increasingly likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the political scene would not change substantially in the country as well.
The most popular party is still the party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, who won less than 33% of votes again.
Only the socialists have contributed slightly to their popularity, while the anti-austerity party Podemos, or 'Together we can' and Ciudadanos, have been slightly weakened by the popularity of 'citizens'.
The People's Party wants the Socialists and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission the 2017 draft budget by mid-October.
As a representative of the People's Parliamentary Party, Rafael Hernando said, if the government does not succeed and the parliamentary elections will be held for a third time, Spain will become a laughing stock for the whole of Europe.
The purity of the masses in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In the fifth year, beaches have seen the number of landlocked waste growing each year, and most of them have been blamed for the number of landlocked visitors.
The most polluted sites are in Riga.
At the end of the day, it is clear from the point of view that the bathing sites make a coup on a daily basis, but the fight against the dirty visitors is quite difficult.
Furthermore, waste abandoned by land may be squeezed into water during rainfall, thus seriously damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzeme, purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This week's announcement was made by volunteers of the "My Sea."
For the fifth year, the road was on the road along the Gulf of Riga, the activists concluded that the number of waste left to the population was rising for a hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year's assessment of the critical nature of this exercise has come to an end.
"We can see that this will be a year when the amount of waste per 100 metres may possibly even exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme, spokesman for the expedition of the expedition.
The Latvian Radio was called on the beaches of the Riga coast, where he continued his voluntary trip to the Gulf of Riga.
This year, between the various municipal waste and the activist, the activists have had to collect even the light bulbs that have been left to mourning in the sea's sand.
The operator and the organiser Ulme tear, who are responsible for the contamination, are the people who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the visiting beaches, since more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste from mixtures, plastic pieces, which are already at a stage of degradation, can no longer be identified and smoked, bottles, cork," said Ulme.
There is also a bathing water in Riga between the cleanest beaches.
In Daugavgra, for example, almost 800 waste units collected per hundred metres each, which is critical.
The organisers of the campaign also make clear that you also smoke every step and not block warning or ban signs everywhere.
"The average figures for all three sites in Riga, together with Daugavgrids, dinner and grandparents - regrettably go much and far beyond the desired goal, which Latvia is making, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020," the environmentalist said.
The cleaning up of the Bathing Castle in Riga every day, even twice on the summer wars, the spokesman, Ugar Vidauskis, said.
However, the fight against the dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural issue.
"Those who cite, consume alcohol and do all things that cannot, even special signs, work," he said.
It therefore calls on the police to report to the police on polluters as well.
It is possible to call the police, to point out these violations and thus to fight for all.
Perhaps some new warnings may be imposed, but as I said, it will hardly change the situation as a radical change.
He said that "we all have to be able to turn to and be intolerant to such perpetrators."
Meanwhile, the quality of water quality measurements in the fourth time this summer were carried out by a Health Check, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as for other years, water quality is good and satisfactory.
At the moment, the situation is that all 56 bathing water sites have been good for the whole and there is no bathing restriction.
"The last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," said Normunds Kadiwal, the senior inspector for environmental health, at the end of August.
In the case of heavy rains, waste abandoned on land may be squeezed into water.
This may have an impact on the quality of this, according to an environmental expert.
In the Russian elite, a change of head of Putina administration continues.
I did not leave my post?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanovs would leave the post as a member of the Parliament and will continue to be a president for nature conservation, ecology and transport in the future.
In announcing the changes, Putin's television cameras have devoted Ivanov to the words: 'Dear Sergej Borisovič, we work together for many years and are doing so successfully'.
I am pleased with how you are performing the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well for our agreement not to use you as head of administration for more than four years.
That is why I am conscious of your willingness to change the field of activity.
And I hope that, in your new role, you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is pointed out that the administration of the President is a very important job and that it made Ivanovs one of the most influential people in the country.
As the State Duma elections are expected in Russia next month, it is rumoured that this step is related to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanovs was also called a possible substitute for Putin as president, and the claim that he himself wanted to hold a post as president on the subject of nature conservation and transport has raised doubts.
According to the Archive Archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanovs is the KGB and a head of the Federal Security Service.
Ivanovs has been a salt and close to the allies of President Vladimir Putin of the Russian President.
He was launched in 1975, where he was kicked off with Putin.
He later became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became a deputy.
Meanwhile, the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed as a Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
The "Information Security Doctrine" was approved in 2000 after Putin's entry into power, which included the revitalisation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2003, Sergei Ivanovs became Russian defence minister but already in 2005 for the Deputy Prime Minister, Mikhail Fradkova, and was responsible for the development of the Russian defence industry and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also remain in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the administration, Waino, will also work.
The message comes from the family Soviet party elite.
The head of the President's administration, Vaino, was appointed by Ivanov himself.
We have known with Antonu Eduardovic for a long time.
Those days when we worked in the government under your leadership.
And for the past almost five years, we are in the process of communicating practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that he is ready for this work," said Ivanov.
The message comes from the family who belonged to the Soviet elite.
His grandfather Karls has held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, which was its first Secretary.
The internet exhibition "Meduza" with a reference to the book "Estonia's self-determination and independence" writes that, at the end of the 1990s, Karls Waino had asked Moscow to grant permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he had been refused and he had lost his post.
Shortly afterwards Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute for International Relations and is governed by the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's protocol.
As reported, in recent unscathed Russia, the reprisals of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of governor and federal governors, have been overshadowed by the recent unscathes of Russia.
As the polylogists point out, President Vladimir Putin is reacting to the ruling elite ahead of the elections in 2018.
One of the main features - more and more often, is the representatives of the bodies of power to senior positions.
Jagifog was also lost in the first battle of the Olympic Games in New York.
This was the first time that Latvia was fighting for the first time in the Olympic Games.
Trenler Oleg Baskin told Latvian Television that the hopes of Niciforenko had been very short, and that this had already been clear before the competition.
He also pointed out that the judner had been wiped out in the fight.
Significantly, in order to be able to travel to the Olympics, New Ticiforenko has had to start in a different weight category than that used for by weight, i.e. by weight of up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan was more than 25 kilograms of heavier.
As reported, Jevgenijs Borodavko in the weight category to 100 kilograms of Rionosuki stood for two and a half minutes until the audience succeeded in a pure pure.
As a result, Latvia has closed the Rhine competition in Rio.
The clothes are disappearing in Rio's sand.
The day was launched by Jevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more comfortable opponent in return, but at times it is possible to surprise.
He did not make it.
The task of Niciforenko was even more complex, because experience smaller and opponents are also in need.
The result is similar, even though he held up nearly one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, it is the most urgent lack of ambition for the Latvian uprising.
"We're going to have to be in the Golden Score," he said, adding that he had been in the Golden Score from Latvia from Latvia.
Mr Jackestich, who is advising Kazakhstan's jughts here, and the heirs of Wei Zoony, do not see my heirs.
But if we do not grow, there will not be.
And that is the prerogative of federation.
As a result, the Latvian federation federation's President, Rate Panorama, defeated the promise of the president of Latvia's federation to fight for the medals.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening, Samoilovs / Smob Solbergs, Evane / Pee Solbergs, was awaited by the beaches of the beaches and the Pee Solbergs.
Intrigs as the death of the 'death' group have ended up as a result of the losers.
While Latvia's duplicate was a small derogation, it could not be lost by up to four points in two.
The crowd was still stuck in a long-standing match.
Nobody wanted to die - this sentiment above the wind-up cort of the entire mask.
The winds of the crowds led to further complications.
At the beginning, it seemed that it could be ours - which is more comprehensive - an ally.
But it was not.
The Latvian duplicate was enough to play here.
I'm so Samoilova and I'm waiting for him to bury.
Canada was burned, against Cuba in the end of the first six, and at the beginning of the third, because the load was in a joke.
The moin could have been at the time, because the work was short, but when it was done, it was done to the honesty.
Meanwhile, Samoilovs was able to win two seasons in two seasons with 16: 15, while remaining 16.
But it was also possible to lose with 0: 2 because the second sixth deficit was -4, but thanks to the wind, it was possible to win.
The third one was the Evane Conservative.
The chain was in the chain - unconvincing accommodating unconvincing effect, the second beautifully close to the network and the Samoilovam left very little in the way of an offensive attack.
If the Cubans had an unfamiliar Samoilovs in the square then he was better at this time, and only for the loss would be unprofessional.
The Krevlin was wrong, and it was symbolic of him that the last bomb block was exactly the same.
Look at the team.
This time was certainly lacking in luck: in the third six, the two attacks by Evane almost came out of the corrupt, but the ball was still affected by the line.
Two elegs were next to the line.
The contentious episode was a video in favour of opponents.
If, in the first two games, Evane were blown up with the server, it was very productive for us.
Collectively, we lost a tap on the taboo.
There is now a calm analysis of the causes of the failure.
Perhaps it should have been as a number of people next to the stadium, not together with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Kiggenfurt should not have to play but to come here sooner and better accentuate.
Maybe it was a mistake to find the top of the sportspeople.
There are now more questions than answers.
Our beautiful game ended up in the game.
The dream came out of the medals.
What happens next?
Some other World Cup tournaments and Jurmala Masters are still behind.
Smoking has never been friends and will not be in the life of Samoilova, because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary.
When a dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of separation may also appear, because the blame will be sought not only in the face but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to get away, but it is much harder to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play a beautile, while Jānis has already tried and beaten, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start conquering the world's top.
The Haraldu Regimes, Alexander Soloveu, Edlong Toc, may be trying to return to the Munich Islands, but it will not be better than this, which has not only shown itself at World Cup stage once.
They never smiled for them this time.
Everything.
Of course, it must also be borne in mind that beaches are becoming more popular, new couples at circulation, and only the rare fruit is less than two metres.
It does not guarantee success yet, but is an important argument in the fight for victories.
There is no longer any longer.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to live in the places offered by the Games, as well as to choose their own choice.
The US Basketball Square is living on cruise ship, parts of tennis do not remain in the Olympic village.
Likewise, part of the beacher's beautile has been found in a hotel in the Synthesis.
This time, the much-modest overnight accommodation of the journalists who are being offered to journalists has been demanding very exaggerated prices.
Therefore, the choice was also reduced to the Irish hall.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from the logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with the rental apparatuses of Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir on the Code of Compact and Ipanham.
In a row of 200 metres, the widening of the athlete was taken on the march.
Rajon is safe, because the patron of the favelas, however, must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimír Academy is not what occasionally imagined, but the most professional journalist in the Russian media, Vladimir Ivanovs, was the most professional journalist.
The dream of another medalous dream seems to have been dreamed up on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidina, 100 metre, was lagging behind his personal record.
But there are already five discipline.
After 10 years of 'Porgijs and Besa', it is Liepaja.
Porgijs and Besa were the first to become early in 1973 at the Latvian National Operation.
Since then, the internationally recognised dosage has repeatedly failed.
That is why the organisers of the Ceusu Festival and the Liepaja Armed Forum, in close cooperation, have decided to give audiences the opportunity to enjoy George Guiev's chip.
"It is a great pleasure for us that after a decade of interruption, where Liepaja has been able to become a operational lesson for the last time, this great version of George King, Porgy and Besa operatio, is enjoying us to us in the new newly-open concert hall," Baiba Bojae, head of the Lielais engines concert hall.
The "Porgijs and Besa" operation has expressed the story of love, its volatility, passion, as well as life tragedies and simple daily connotations.
It reflects afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this operation that this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, that is an extremely powerful, extremely beautiful, extremely beautiful, and really deep," said the director Viesturs Cairsime.
What I like most of all is that, listening or matching this operation, there are always stops like the famous melody, the famous motives, but those transitional bridges from one of the other to the other, highlighting one person or the other person, or corrupt or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this construction," he said, adding that "Porgijs and Besa" will be the guarantor of the concert at Porgijs and Besa.
Visitors of the operation are in agreement that this is a major event.
It is a great pleasure for them to listen to this famous Guernshir Opera in the world.
Sadly, Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
The enforcement professional Edgars Lami is an MEP.
The concert was in particular in orchestra's first open concert hall and was the first to play for the first time in an open concert hall.
In the case of the renovated buildings of the Art Museum, agriculture could be named in the name of Jay Rozental.
Riga deputy mayor, Andris Ameriks, in the opening ceremony at the Rozenthen anniversary exhibition, said that the address of a museum could not be the same for the future, not in the case of Kim Valdemary's Street Ten, while Jay Rozenthan square 1.
The reregistration of Muzsee's director, Muzsee, said that the re-registration of the address will create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but generally welcomes this idea and has therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
The city of Riga has fled to this idea in 196.6 by creating a Burkarda monument to Janim Rozental, a museum who is standing at a museum.
The former director of the museum, Vilhelb, was one of the initiators for this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little crushed by conscience at all times - but Vilhelm Purvitis, where we will make his name?
"But if you're trying to think about it," he said.
The National art Museum, after an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation process, was officially celebrated in May this year.
This week will finally start the reconstruction of the WEF Cultural Bank.
A total of around €11 million will be upgraded to Velve.
It is planned to renovate several ERC spaces, including two spectacles, as well as adjusting buildings to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract EU funds worth €six million, but Oleg Burovs, Director of the Riga City Council's Department of Property Department, said that the project is not yet fully clear on European funds.
"Despite the political will to launch the MEF culture pitch, attracting the European Structural Funds, there are, for months, a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, it will be allocated or not," says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you would take the decision itself that Brussels would not take a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussions happening again, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be in place and completed in time," said Burov.
As more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Bank was collectively held in a collective concert before the start, immediately refurbishing the building.
One year later, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
In the Riga City Council's strategy, the EREF cultural ERC renovation is divided into seemingly independent transformation work where each will ensure the implementation of different ERC functions.
The first is increasing access to EREF culture for culture and preserving the surrounding area.
It is intended to put in place the surroundings and the engineering and to restore the premises of the building stock.
Second - improving the provision of the EF for Cultural Estimates services.
It envisages an improvement in the interface, wall and ceiling of the building, an improvement in the theatre and sound recording of the buildings, and the sorting of internal engineering of buildings.
Third: improving the working conditions of Creative amateur, including plans to improve workload equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Prior to the Bundesliga's 40th birthday, he could get an exhibition at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will display different articles of "good" photographs in the line to reflect the start of the group's activities by 2010, when the end of the group's operation is announced.
The participants will also see the actors' theatre, musical tools, awards and concerts, as well as other cases that have not yet been seen by the wider public, which have been reflected in the creative activities of the Luge group.
The exhibition will be supplemented by Liepaja's Museum's Matting.
The visual presentation of the exhibition is in cooperation with the fashion artist and the Elder Patmalener of Eltalenae.
There were also musicians linked to the Lotres and their loved ones to the call and shared both objects and memories.
Launched in 1972 in the city of Liepaja in the city of Liepaja, it was set up in the city of Liepaja in the city of Liepaja, which was led by Juris Pavinoe.
Liepablis has participated in the Liepaja Liepaja engine in 1972 and 1974 as well as in the eyes of cities and republic.
In 1974, Juris Pavik was in the process of meeting the King Cavaliers and established a group to join Ingrid Gistry, Andri Krumins and Jang Grodums.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been disregarded only once.
The participants have joined, others have taken their way, some have returned.
Above all, the desire to confirm that Latvian Roma is able to live and survive remains unchanged.
"What can be seen by a lack of jihadists, hairches and barracks, these boys have been distinguished by the universally accepted scramble of the snow," Kigm War, the music manager, says in the group.
The group, without previously mentioned musician Igo, Vilnis Krievins, Modris Štern, Valdis Štark, Laimis, Tim Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brles, Guntars Muga, Tomaxis Clein and many others.
It shall be exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition will take place from 19 August to 30 October.
On the other hand, Lugds will be in the top of the game in Liepaja's World Cup qualifiers on 27 August.

Mr Stankevicius has time and the truth is rising.
Archyte of the Catholic Archbishop of Latvia's Catholic Church, Mr Stankekevich, in an interview with Nelied, emphasized that if we want to gain a life, the Gospel message must be put at the centre.
Because the strength of the truth is greater than the whim of evil.
Many people are already on the way to the most sacred New York Marie Skills in Aglona.
What message does believers have there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been set by the Pope's Pope.
Consequently, the content of the main message is also in his hands.
It is also a kind of tradition that will develop in the way the Kusta road is managed by the Bishop George Buslis.
He, too, will make his own message.
I wrote a pilgrimage magazine on the previous day.
Last year, I turned to Pope Francis's Pictures, Laudato si, and to an updated common home, the theme of the Earth in Latvia.
This year, of course, I am watching what is happening in the world and trying to respond to it in his address.
My approach coincides with the church suggested that the Gospel wind should be put at the centre of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel is responsible for the hardest problems of human life and gives him inspiration for the way forward.
Then it is addressing people.
But in Ceuta, during the discussion in the Channel, you said that 'you should return to the full human awareness'.
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person would turn away from a church's message?
And is there a resource of such a return today for a church?
A man dying on the side of the Indian capital is robbing the side of the road.
In the capital city of India, nobody will ever know about a debilitant man who died on the side of the road: he turns out that he was taken on the side of an hour and then robbed, informs the BBC.
A man who identified a man like Maticonstitue was on a dawn day and worked at night as a guard.
It was 5: 30 from the morning when the light car was shot.
The driver's record showed that the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim and then leave.
After a hour when no one has ever come to know about a disgraceful man, he was robbed by one's own garden.
About 90 minutes after the departure, the police arrived at the police and the victim was taken to hospital where the injuries died.
By withdrawing his candidacy to the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), Inga Kolegova, head of the State Environmental Service, has rescued the government from criticism, according to Professor Ohar Skudra, an associate professor of Social Science at the University of Latvia.
Kolegova's explanation of the candidacy for the controversy in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the government's fall.
He told LETA that he was hard to imagine that he would support Kolegova's candidacy at a government meeting next week.
As a result, if the ministers of Unity had voted against, while Kolegova would be so in office, this would lead to the government's resignation.
He also believes that Kolegova had been consulted by Finance Ministers Danu Reizniece-Ozola, as well as Prime Minister Mars Kucinski, before announcing a declaration of candidature.
At the same time, it was a concession to the 'Unity', which stood firmly against her candidacy.
Sudra acknowledged whether a suitable candidate would be in progress, whether a compromise figure would either be chosen, or the authority, as the Director-General, would continue to be chaired by Dace Peleka, as Director General.
At the same time he says that if the finance minister had so far claimed that another candidate was not present, it was a house in the Pelle that he should not take part in the contest.
As reported, Kolegova, head of the State Environmental Service, has decided to withdraw the candidacy of the Revenue Service's director-general.
The government postponed the approval of the Revenue Service's director-general on Tuesday, due to opposition from Unity.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that it was still ready to become the head of the Revenue Service.
However, he later changed: on Friday, she referred to the transfer of his consent to the Revenue Service's post to Minister of Finance Danai Reiznie-Ozot and he had no easy choice.
Andrei Vaivars, spokesman of Prime Minister Mari Vaivars told LETA that a new contest will be held on the vacant post of the vacant VID.
A police car involving the police has been in the centre of Riga.
At the centre of Riga this afternoon, a road traffic accident involving the State Police car was carried out.
The police car with the locked sound and light signals rushed to the highest category of the class until the streets of the Strar Barona and Dzirnava battled by another car.
The police explains the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second game has not missed the police car.
A woman has suffered an accident in the event of an accident.
Healthy population in Riga
At the beginning of this year, 638 784 people were residents, which is 0. 34% less than in 2015 when 641 000 residents were officially registered in 2015, the Central Statistical Authority informed LETA.
On the other hand, the Latvian capital ranks 30th among the European Union's (EU) capitals and the large cities of more than one million inhabitants.
According to Eurostat data, Riga is the largest female population, with the Latvian capital being confident in the first place between Europe's major cities with 127 women to 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic States, there is the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: 123 in Vilnius, and in Tallinn, 121 women on 100 men.
A warning pictogram will be set up for the LNMM.
In the coming days, the Latvian National arts Museum (LNMM) will deploy warning signs, pictograms, the Riga City Council department spokesman Baiba Gailte told LETA.
At the moment, the repair of a museum's glass wounds has been successfully concluded as a result of the practice of carabouts.
In the coming days, it will be set up for warning pictograms.
For its citizens, it will be indicated that cover is a matter of sick and during the snow, it should not be transported by cars, but also by bicycles, owees and oils.
Ushakovs also wrote on Facebook at the time, who said that any safety threats were not caused by the damage, but "look nee," and "we'll be drunk."
Young children and the elderly at Riga are young children's playgrounds.
In this summer's season, the Riga local government has even set up two new playgrounds in the city, the Coast and Chiekurkalna, which are already available to children.
A large, multifunctional herring vessel is installed at the beach on the beach, with different lakes, bridges, games, trubs and airstrikes.
The playground is for children of all ages.
In agriculture, cells and variations in balancing are also installed.
The world of anthroposia is protracted by a despair in Daugava on small shippers with a view to a passenger port and cruise cruise there.
On the other hand, in a plale square between the Chiekurkalna (4 and 5), games of games, batuts, grade milk tracks, equals, cells, playballs and other elements of games, as well as an area of gymnastics with purse force and coordination exercises, co-formulants, etc.
There was a quantum cover in the square of the square in various colours.
Up until the playground field, a new paint paint cold was put on the street from the street.
The hunt is open to the reconstruction phase.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, the management of the Latvian National Roroads (LVC), as well as the representatives of the construction board SIA "Binders," and local authorities today unveiled the reconstructed border of the country's main motorway (Grebaneva) - Resekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (A13) from the hunt to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05 505).
Road is the country's visit, especially in the border routes, so it is particularly gratifying to open up a reconstruction phase at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement in national central roads thanks to cofinancing from European Union funds.
"As predictions show, the funds available for roads during this programming period will already be in 2018, and we need to think about continuing to maintain the most burdensome roads of very high quality and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without the funding of the European Union," Uldis Augulis, a symbol of the symbolic rally, told us.
The Transport Ministry's proposals for sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will also be presented in the government.
The construction works from the hunt to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,5 km), SIA Binders, started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The design section of the renovated road is a complete road design and next year will be the next year of the Daugavpilij in the next phase, so the whole road from Lithuania's border to Daugavpilij will be sorted out," said Janis Lange.
The country's main motorways are busy, and by 2018 we are planning to ensure that all the national roads are in good shape.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality through the timely provision of periodic maintenance and the replacement of the asphalt top-down every 7-9 years.
"Of course it will need adequate funding, and all the people looking forward to the proposals of the panel of experts for sorting out the road financing system," Mr Lange said.
The project is matching road connection and lighting in the centre of the hunt.
Significant land occupations: In four phases, large quantities of large scale rotation and massive inflammatory and embankment work, equalise the route of the roads, which until now was very uneven.
Upgrading of public transport stops and newly constructed fields for public transport.
In the past, there was an immense impasse and the terrain were not transparent because of the mountains of mountainous valves, as well as the way in which the old path was shared.
The next building is planned to restore the road section from the city of Daugavpils to the reconstruction phase now in place (144,80-156.40 km).
This year, the LVC is planning to carry out various types of work of more than 1100 km of national roads.
Information on all the renovations on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.ence.lv.
"The right choice of food combinations is essential to achieve the desired mass reduction results," said Lithuanian dietology Laura Romeraite-contracty.
Moreover, it is easy to do during the summer period when the fresh fruit, the berries and the vegetables are growing in our own gardens.
Positive combinations of nutrition products can help not only to reduce overweight, but also to target the different processes in a targeted way.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, because they ensure a long-lasting sense of snow and help with fats.
Studies published in the European Clinical diet magazine have shown that the label has a positive impact on blood levels and helps us to feel cheerful.
Kuminous pipari and protein rich meals, such as poultry or protein cocktails, are not only a scourge of the cheese, but also reduces the likelihood of a great deal of mesh in the next edible.
A combination of such meals is also capable of increasing the amount of calorific to 35% of the incoriated calorific.
Studies have shown that the Kajraan pipare can help to get rid of the leftist in the area.
The glass contains a metabolising nutrient - cholera, while the weather is a good source of vitamin C.
Being sufficient nutrients can reduce the level of corrupt, and hence the accumulation of fat around the average of the body.
The beauty of the hosts to which fresh berries are added is another taste and fat burning meals that are worth including in their menu.
Pictures and berries contain fibre which, according to the conclusions of the Canadian scientists, controls the sink - the appetite of appetite hormones - and, therefore, a sense of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyfenols, which are palliative to weight reduction, and also prevent the formation of fat.
Others and protein are also able to do miracle in reducing their weight.
Such a combination is capable of generating a sense of sentiment.
The soils contain water and fibre, and therefore they encourage a sense of snow.
At the same time, proteins are slowing down the digestive process and providing a sense of snow for a long time.
In lunch, a chicken can be eaten with a straw, or the protein cocktails can be prepared from a finished mixture and enjoy it together with their favourite vegetables.
How to avoid product combinations.
There are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecules compounds.
On the other hand, starches in vegetables are polysaccharide.
Fruit is divided by mechanical angle, while chemically not separated until reaching the third or fourth stage in the digestive process taking place in the intestine.
The starches are divided into three different phases, starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the straw of the straw immediately after the meal.
By eating the food straight on the meal immediately after the meal, it is stuck in the corner with other meals, where it is not chemically exhausted and starts to work.
Don't eat bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, computer or other carbohydrate products, together with citrus, happy, orange, gasiphite, ananasae or other acids.
Enzinds ptialine, which are contained in the tracks, only operate in a alkalo environment.
Plant acids are not only impeded by the diversion of carbohydrates, but also by their fermentation.
Not eating eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese, nuts and nuts, meat and milk, eggs, milk or nuts, and combinations of milk and similar protein rich products in the same food.
Their recycling requires different digestive juice, each with different strength, characteristics and time when the angle has to reach.
Argua, the media, musical and other melons must always be eaten separately from other meals.
The Black is not squeezed out of the angle, along with other foodstuffs.
A combination of rich products with rich protein products.
The people are a successful combination with respect, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fat is hampering protein decomposition.
protein can be combined with very little fat.
If a large amount of products containing proteins is consumed, the use of fat is avoided.
This also applies to freing: it is not advisable to combine a large number of nuts (containing protein) with a healthy source of fat (containing fat).
Such a combination shall impede effective weight reduction.
How can we better prepare?
"Cooking, thermic treatment generates a significant loss of nutrients - around 15% to 55% of the original nutrient content of products."
In the majority of cases, nutrients are being lost when food is collected in water.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods is increasing in particular.
After the tapping of vegetables, it is advisable to use the liquid for the preparation of the horse - in this case, you will not lose the nutrient that has remained in water and you can eat them later.
It would be advisable for the sites to be prepared in vain, including in vain.
Divergence would significantly increase the availability of oppressive bioavailability in tomatoes.
With a maximum of 30 minutes per minute, the amount of opium is increasing by 25%.
Divergence has also significantly increased the availability of betawarn bioavailability found in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, in the Balkans, in sweet potatoes and in the corrupt.
Processing of seals and meat containing meat shall deprive the natural properties of the proteins present, making them more comfortable.
Equally, the thermal treatment of meat and eggs makes the use of iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb into the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while the freezing of fibre is not affected by the freezing of the fibre.
A combination of tomatoes with tomatoes can increase the presence of iron intake in a body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle.
Our organism hosts up to 33% of the less blood iron that can be found in plant products such as boilers, leaf, cereal products, than the cardiovascular iron present in animal products of the country of animals such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the disintegration of non-cardiovascular iron intake into the body, using non-cardiovascular iron products together with the vitamin sources of the vitamin, such as oranges, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change the blood iron in such a way that our organisms absorb it more easily.
The iron is necessary for the production of a hemoular in providing oxygen for muscular and brains.
To derive maximum benefit from the sweeteners, add healthy fat, such as olive or seseed oil.
When preparing butter with a reading, add to the vitamin of the vitamin or skimmed of the vitamin or the sardine, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the quantity of intestinal calcium in intestinal and plays a key role in the process of bone formation.
Alcohol (as well as other FPAs), along with the vitamin sources, such as strawberries, butteres, trawl and other fruit or coal, help to stabilise the level of cholesterol and avoid the draining of arteries.
Snapchat "Anime's effect, criticizes for sickness caricatures
Snapchat representatives say that this film has inspired animation, but some commentators claim that it is racist insensitivity.
With this slow effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users, in a daily way, to change reality in a very absurd way and to play their own identity.
You can convert yourself into an ancient, dog or image that would be fed into a guest of Roja Lihštenstein.
Scares are rabbits, imaging, which generates more than 30 million converted selftres per day.
Any mistake is rapidly becoming public.
Snapchat snoys have already been criticised in the past, with accusations being made that the application is to be spread to too black or brightly skin sheets such as the ideal beautiful etalon.
This week, new lenses were published, allowing users to build eyes, hat and shoes, and some critics called it a racist caricature of racist sights.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not show that the company has more problems with diversity.
News and public disorder were fired on Wednesday when the Verge and Motherboard expenditures that they had been removed from the lakes.
The company explained that the aim is to portray Anmog's fathers rather than to carcass people from the villages.
However, people who have experienced racism have reminded them of the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarities with Ankara.
In her statement on the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the playoffs, he said, "the sentiments were" insulting and uncomfortable and uncomfortable, "he said.
She added that it is difficult not to discover the obvious similarities between the asisees cartoons and the slow effect of cheap effects.
This shows that the slow effect is not simply a yellow face but a yellow face for racism.
Snapchat is not the only company which has been caught in these cultural traps.
The American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business premises to Holivones and the devices we use in everyday life.
The Snapchat large audience of young people, who represent different race, unlike older citizens, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat's slow lenses establishes an image that offsets users, then "these things do not remain unnoticed nowadays," he said in an interview with a 25-year-old Keitiy on Thursday.
On Thursday, the head of the Medium of Medium, Martin, erupted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article, the "Medium" and a telephone interview, she explained that she believes that problems related to race arise as a result of the Snapchat employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
He criticised the company's management, consisting mainly of white men and then concluded its article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat..
"This means that there are no race diversity in the company, so there are some other representatives of the other race in the company, but they do not take up office to make sure that they are safe and easy to express their opinions," he said.
Others agree with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many of the staff represent different race, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but the representative found that the company was a member of staff who will focus on the representation of minorities in the company, who are not widely represented and will facilitate their integration into the company.
He will not be renewing his Snapchat account, adding: 'I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that it is wrong'.
The House of Congress states that military officials have missed reports of reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Lords Chamber states that the US Central Commonwealth has distorted reports by depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in a much more optimistic manner than in reality.
The analysts of the Central Commander's intelligence service analysts express general dissatisfaction at the interim report of the task unit set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Commonwealth Committee and the Republican Representatives of the Defence Funding Sub-Committee, indicating that their management had controlled reports on the efforts of the Americans in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Commander, known as Centcom, is the military base in Tampu, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report is that the intelligence service reports approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect more positive in the US's fight against terrorism than in reality; the facts were regularly distorted, depicting better progress than other intelligence analyses show.
Californian's Republican representative Ken Kallas tells us: "The behaviour of Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are found in the senior management of the organisation.
This 10-page report highlights the existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central orders of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide inconclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration had distorted the reports, it shows that the Centcom has made some of the pressure on analysts a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that, in the first half of 2015, the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Administration on Congress depicted the situation in a much more positive light than was actually the case.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the recovery operation for Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city under the control of the Islamic State.
Ms Pompeo, the representative of the Republican Republican Party in Cancún, says in his report: 'A number of months of investigation are clearly proof of this'.
Between 2014 and mid-2015, the main officials of the US Central Management Authority have distorted reports by depicting the weakest of the ISIS in Iraq than they were in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As part of the investigation, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new discoveries in this case.
Inspection by the Ministry of Defence is carrying out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
A member of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Regulatory Committee published its own report on Thursday, in which they agreed on some of the conclusions of the Republican Party working group.
In her report, the representative of the Democratic Representative, Aams B. Šifs, said, between 2014 and 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of the intelligence reports in relation to the ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information," worsened analysts' ethics and "distributed the facts unsuitable to the truth."
But members of the Shiff and Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has exerted pressure on the Centcom analysts to report according to "predetermined or political positions."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress's investigation on Thursday.
In August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Inspection General had launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman Patrik Evans said Pentagon will not comment on the congress report until the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpreted complex data sometimes, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence agency are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
Investigations are not just about whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (the statement made by more and more representatives of the Defence Ministry).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports from the Central Authority on the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic State was reminiscent of the events of more than ten years, when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregorijs Harker, published a study saying that the Bush Administration launched the Afghan war, with too little thought about its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in detecting the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Her team discovered that air strikes had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the Islamic State oil plants, as they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market, contrary to public reports.
The Times reported in the edition of the Times that this discovery was not beyond the walls of the Central Authority.
At the moment, Centcom commander General Loid Ostins III received sharp criticism because many lawmakers thought that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April General Ostins went on holiday and she came in for him.
In the United States, the United States relied with Britain in the field of women's hockey hockey, winning the United States, which won the fourth consecutive match.
On the other hand, Kim Bama scored 6: 1 in the United States for the first two goals of the U.S. Women's Basketball Championship.
Five times in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bama said that it was not possible to remember whether she had ever been able to do so.
She said: 'I do not know'.
I am not one of those people who are counting their own gates.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them the United Kingdom with a 2-0 win over Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in order to play the last game.
The two teams have already been qualified a quarter and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in a group of six teams and whose second place is to be replaced by the team.
The winner of the first is a little longer to avoid a meeting with a strong Dutch sample, the leader of the second group.
While I did not look at the game of Saturday, the Americans have had a storm of surprise four years ago in London.
It was in the team that there was a Bama in the team.
She went up in the first three years of his first career in the NBA club, who had 16 years old, while she was 16 years old.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because he did not fall into the conflict.
However, 2012 was a failed year for her and her team.
In the next year, a English King Parhama was appointed for a ranking coach and everything changed for the better.
It was described as' cultural, mentality and physical change '.
In London, we did not invest so much as it is now.
We have changed everything completely.
The days of the day opened the game in the first half of the game in the first half of the game.
India started the game without winning in his account, but their screen was very fierce and had a minimum result at the end of the third period of the period of 1. 1 to the end of the third period.
She entered the square on the side of the square in the square in the square, then saw the middle of the square in the square and to send a bomb to the editorial gates, with the Americans 2: 0.
Melisa Gonzala scored one more goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
In each of the first three games, the Bridge of Bruge is the first in the first three games.
She is stuck.
And so also Bama.
"We are going very well at the moment," said Pahama, but as well as it is, it will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is the 'Smart meal'.
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Delano Rūche sat in the beautiful room in order to run the meal.
President Ron was astonished by fine arinary dams such as a toothstone bag, a futile and a Merilenza boy.
On the other hand, his mess was much more modest on the road: eggs of eggs in tomatoes, potatoes and potatoes, which were filled in the scrap.
James Ziegelmans says: "This is a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who have been very hard off."
Her husband, her husband, added: 'It is also a message to the Americans as to how to eat'.
A couple of Brooklyn Heights is historian historians.
The final book, 'Driving the Train', describes Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelmane describes in his book 97 Abeleles a life through meals at the headquarters of the economist in the eastern part of Manhatta.
Their new joint work on the "Say Malsin" to be published on Tuesday in Harper is a story of American food at the time of the Great Depression.
By showing a degree of solidarity in gastronomy, they descended in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch in the district of Batirona, from 1929 when the great depression began.
For 54 years old Ziegelmanes commissioned a butter with the rhetoric cheese and with olives, while the 57 year old Koa ordered a bicycle, potato tree and vegetable salt.
When the reporter ordered a fake grew, a couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for the end of the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmans said that the fake was very popular.
There was a sleepnut, a hair of the liver and a lap of the boat.
They were made from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
It seems like it is that it is so much to eat so much so that it is half a lunch.
Mr Kou said.
"It seemed likely to be full of lead," he added.
In the years of primary depression, the American lunch was similar to that of the Swedish head, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their workers and lunch, lunch, lunch and dinner provided fresh paints that were prepared.
In the first World War, it was the Americans who sent the Europeans the food. The 'Sound meal' describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances in which America suddenly was no longer a land of wealth.
"At that time, the food became the main focus of the American people on a day-to-day basis," Mr Kou said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
It was just as important for the new budget to have become the new budget: an unknown escort such as the fake guns and tears became a day of everyday life, the perception was an "excellent way to make use of surpluses," said Mrs Ziegelmans, because the cookers could conceal the unattractive components below staple measurements.
Sound fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main component of American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury of luxury.
At a time when the calorie population and food have a nutritional value over long, born, new, yet unprecedented forms.
In an old book in Ziegelmanes, Mrs Ziegelmanes found a recipe for making a cooking butter with a glass butter.
Mr Kou said: 'It was not a popular top-down table'.
Mrs Ziegelmans emphasises: "It was real."
The butter butter and the smile are not compatible.
Many of the prescriptions of meals have been applied for the difficult times.
household economists, such as Luck Stenley, head of the Federal Office for the Economy of Homeland, from 1923 to 1943, determined the eating habits of state eating, which was not experienced before the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended to be 'economists' for housemakers and to accept the challenges such as turning the carrot and carrot microphone into a splendid edge.
The 'Say Maltete' is a historical staple of history.
Especially interesting is evidence of the government's attitude to its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Huver, let me eat the cake 'attitudes.
Although in public he spoke of his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, he was in fact eating as a millionaire of what he had had.
Mr Kou tells: 'He likes Europe's kitchen, for example, fish with a cucumber'.
He was eaten almost under a cold sert, wearing a lunch rainy.
He was completely out of reality.
President Rehn would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book told the house that he was a domestic worker who did not teach to eat up, so the White Nama became a place "where not only was one of the most unfettered meals in Washington, but also the worst of the mega-like meals."
As soon as the national economy turns out, most of the depression of gastronomy culturally disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional and how to use science in gastronomy, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
A couple of people are saying that they received a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs Ziegelmanes, for example, why she was unable to throw out the food.
"She's really afraid of throwing out food," said Mr Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmans said: 'She is actually thoughting people'.
Once there was a incident with wind melts.
When we were eating Eisenberga, the writer was pulling a desert from the bag at home: the floodplains that the President estered on lunch.
"This is a flux of the flow," said Mrs Ziegelmanes, adding that at the time there was a habit of modest meals to give a chicken name.
It does not contain poultry, just dried floods, slightly milal, sugar, water and cane.
Everyone was impatiently caught up in the flags on the brown mass that was on the plate.
In surprisingly, it was not so bad.
Mr Kou eagerates a few more crowds.
After listening to an experienced economist, he said the wife said: "I would like a knife nut."
Gilead will receive reimbursement of legal expenses in the fight against Merck C patents
The judge's judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal services paid in the case of "Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of 200 million pounds of pound on the bond of two Merck patents that were threatened by the successful Soexecutive and Harvons tablets when the US federal judge found irregularities in action, such as lying on the oath of oath and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, US judge Beta Labson Fos said that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to obtain positions on the market against Gilead, which is dominated by the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs, which is effective for 90% of liver disease.
The case was started in 2013, when Gilead and Merck brought each other to trying to gain ownership of the newly developed active component Sopbuvir, which is the main part of Gilead medicinal products.
The US-backed forces claim that the city of Manchester from the Islamic State had completely taken control of the Islamic State.
The US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern part of the country's northern border under the Turkish border and the last Islamic State militants have left the city, a group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city of the last opponents who have not fled the city.
They have freed more than 2000 hostages of civilians who were taken by fighters from militants, Sharfan Darviam from the SDS allies of the SDS allies told Reuters.
"At the moment, the city is under our full control and we are carrying out a fighter search," he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton earnings accounted for USD 10.75 million and a couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Cillary Clinton published the 2015 tax declaration by Hillary Clinton on Friday, showing that the presidential candidate and her husband had earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34,2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton has donated USD 1 million, mainly to its Clinton charity, and former president Bill Clinton earned around $5.3 million, as a leftist and a former state secretary of 3 million dollars from his book on work in the country Departamenta, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's electoral allies, Senator Tims Kein, US Senator, and his wife Anna Holton, have published their tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Timer Kein are continuing to set new standards of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, a partner partner for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind the different pretexts and reservations so as not to keep promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of the information to be paid is recorded practice for presidential candidates, but is not required by the law.
Trump and his lawyers are mentioning the State Department's audit as a reason for not discovering tax information.
Clinton's campaign partner, Ians Sams, was sent by Clinton's campaign partner on Twitter, according to a statement from the Democratic Party Party.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser Michael Isn told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before audits had been completed.
Trump's critics, including Mitt Romny and other Republican presidential candidate in 2012, claim that his refusal raises questions of his real property, donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton picked oil fruits, with a video published on Friday, where several influential Republican people demand Trump to publish his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during the economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She announced the crowd: "He refuses to do what has been done for decades by the other presidential candidates."
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no tax at all, and on Friday the author of a business column in the New York Times said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
The federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the proposal by the billionaire Varena Bafeta, is promoting the idea that anyone who earns more than 1 million dollars a year has to pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Obama.
Last week, speaking at Clinton, in Omahi, where his' Berkshire Hathaway 'conglomerate, Bafeta called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
He said that he was also subject to auditing by the Revenue Service and that Trump was afraid of the electorate and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Now Clinton lives in the Chellow, New York and the average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 per cent, between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's 2015 tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income is wage.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in the dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes in Berlin for opening of Israeli talks following demand from the RT
The director of the Jewish French film director storing a storm in social media when he discovered that a "Kempinski Bristol" in a hotel in Berlin did not have a distance code for Israel.
Captain Lancmans, documentary film for the Shoah director of the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans attempted to find a televised Israeli code of the hotel.
However, the country was not included in the list of countries to which it is possible to call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, in the new German capital, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
max Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol is offering a call to the country via its centre of call.
He asked for clarification from the hotel staff.
Lancmans write that the answer he had received was "I shocked him."
The Hotel administrator explained that "it was a deliberate decision of hotel management."
The reason for the removal of the Code was further angry by the director of the film's director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded that the Israeli tremendox be extinct," Lancmans quoted an explanation from the hotel workers.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakovs Khadas-Handelsmans, called it a "big shame."
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
The fact that this has happened in Germany is precisely the greater humiliation of this hotel network.
There is no need for clarification.
"We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event was quite extensive on the Internet, too, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the "Kempinski" hotel has simply inherited Arab clients.
Another record was "ashaming," saying that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendamm Street next to synagogus.
Der Spiegel's statement said that the hotel himself rejected all accusations, saying it was "misunderstanding" and apologised for Lancmans.
"We have not received a direct order to withdraw Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung cites Kempinski representative.
It adds that the code was again added to the list.
The police is using rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police collisions took place on Thursday in Sanão Paulo in Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms to the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems started when the Ombudsman tried to disappear students, resulting in police use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
A number of students took part in the demonstration to show their displeasure at reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmina, aims to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be moved to other schools for savings.
Some demonstrators pointed to the walls with messages against the interim president, Michael Temeru.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations aimed at expressing support for the deserted President Dma Rousefai, which was voted overwhelmingly by a senate.
Scottish Tiners, first of all, first to leave Britain for cycling.
Tell Skiners from Scottish's finalists for the first two cycles of the season in the Rio bond at the Rio bare last night last night, while British team secured its title for the 2012 London City.
A 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making it proud of Scottish Seru Krisu Hood, who was legitimised by the outlawed Scoar Seru Krisu Hood, and by winning victory for the favourite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprising victory four years ago, when he won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it again at the World Cup in London, even though Holy had already ended his athlete career.
The problems were between Beijing and London for the Olympics, as it had had to replace the experienced star at the time.
They managed to do so at the last minute.
When he went out he tried to fill in a place in a place in a place where he was in his place and he had to fill in the Mets Kramptons.
British trainers made hope for the Scandinavia, seeing the potential that he later demonstrated.
Hindus, Kenya, a champion four years ago with Hood and Skiners who set up a record of the Olympic qualification, but a better start was for New Zealand
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindus was in close and close with his desk, Kenya was in the lead, and the Spurers secured this leadership.
A change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindus travelled with a greater carry-over to allow Kenya, and the Scandiner in particular, to drive faster.
He was watching a BBC spokesman and watching the eye at the Spurs of the Spurs, Kenya and Hindesa.
The 23-year-old glass said: 'It was an untold honesty'.
I am doing everything to defend my name.
In the rain, we launched the Olympic record and winning the World Cup.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better victory.
Hindus said that Hindus had dropped to the race after the failed start in the 2012 Olympic Games.
Later on, he did away with this comment and British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
This time there was not such an incident.
Hindus said: "Britain's flags have been recalled in the memories of London."
Over the past 3 months, we have become a united team.
We lost so many World Cup, so the Olympic Games was a special victory.
One meal will be said in a country that won seven of the ten golden medals in the Beijing and London cycles.
If this achievement is a team progress rate over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In the face of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the achievements of Holy in three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya it would mean six gold gold gold medals and one silver medal; moreover, Kenya was born on 23 March (it seems to be the British Holy date, because this day there was also a Stalin, Mo Farah and Roger Banister).
There is also a Holy born on that date.
Kenya's next racing is a sprick which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: 'I just enjoy it at the moment.
Comprehensive travel is always the best.
Because it can be won with the teams.
If, frankly, it is a bit of a bit alone to win. "
Hindus said: "If he gets two golden medals, he should be appointed as weapons."
On that day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredliy Vigins, Eds Kland, Steve Burk and Ovein Deuls showed the faster qualification for four kilometres of four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World record, which was set up in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the finger will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, before a qualification trip, he was dispersed with a commissate when the judges called him to measure his crops.
Today, the Laura Trota, Laura Rovsela Šanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Arčibalda, which will continue and end today, install a new record of 4: 13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will fight the medals at the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone is expecting the same achievements.
Meanwhile, the arrogations of sexism and dignity have gone down in different places after accusations of sectarianism and dignity, and the Hood and Viktoria Bendletona also finish the career.
However, the first bicycle race seems to be likely to be at the top of time in the UK as always.
The future of the Car of Portland is becoming unclear, as an ambitious treaty has been interrupted.
The aluminium fighter and the hundreds of its employees in Portland have become uncertain in Ottawa, as its main customer energy company announced a suspension of cooperation.
This communication is based on the plans of the government of Viktoria to cease subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
For 20 years, subsidies will be phased out in November.
More than 2000, the Portland Works are at risk of more than 2000.
Up to 2 000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will have unpredictable side-effects, as the smeller consumes about 10 percent of all the Viktoria electricity supply.
In 2014, the Alcoa battles were removed by the Alcoa smell of the 'Point Henry Henry', which led to the disruption of the Anglesea power plant.
The Portland of Portland works with losses and can be closed.
These events were triggered by a number of years of speculation about the value of the Australian dollar and the costs of factory production.
The power plant AGL, which supplies the energy from the power stations of Loy Yang A, Latroubes Ieleya, says that the other three will probably cease their contracts.
The majority of power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures, including the state-owned CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp (Japan).
AGL hopes to continue the Portland plant operation, which would mean further energy supply in the smelters, "the spokesman said.
AGL said the treaties were so-called "restrictive risk agreements" to enter into force from November 2016.
The Treaties have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
The AGL intends to receive revenues from these contracts in 2017 fiscal year, "said the company's representative.
Starting from the 2018 fiscal year, favourable market forecasts are constrained by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
'AGL 'claims that its forecasts have already taken on board losses of $187 million, providing for these contracts to be terminated.
Alcoa said that the decision to end the contract would not affect Alcoa's options for continuing to operate or supply energy.
In 2010, the US company reported that it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be stopped.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland revolt in Viktoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
Sir Mikelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts were estimated to be using 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts for energy in Portland during the year.
If these two factories were to leave the energy market, then the energy demand would fall considerably.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, and the situation may worsen when the budget is reduced.
Three out of five people in the country, mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal evictions are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will become worse as a result of cuts in funding.
From next June, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
The head of the legal centre of the Cowiney Legal Centre, James Farels, said that the latest report from the National Law of Legal Centres tells us that legal aid is currently being refused thousands of people in need.
Mistrs Farels said that if this decision is not lifted, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre of the Cowland is continually underfunded, meaning that aid is refused for thousands of people who need it'.
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with indebted debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are dishonestly dismissed - all these people have a legal problem - and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
As from June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent, meaning that several thousands of people of the Kwandland population will have to face up to their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and the Lord Basin Senator, George Brandist, to immediately stop the funding cuts so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government launched its plans to increase the level of legal aid to the average of the country.
The time has now come to turn our attention to the needs of local communities and their customers, and the government of Palazčka to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign was suited to court as one of the workers set a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organisers were sued in court because they did not act with information that their leader in North Carolina opened up a firearm against a worker when they travelled in a car in February in one car.
This incident was described in the court's request by Vincents Bordini, a former campaigner of the campaign, on Wednesday at the Court of Sharos.
He said he had waited months for an internal examination of the case, but he understood that this would not happen.
The head of the driver, Congolese Filigrade, was pulling the pistol, put his good figure at the bright and opened the barrel against the Stta Strait, "Bhumi said in his complaint.
He also argues that by complaining to local and regional campaigning, Bordini was aware that at least four people had experienced the same thing.
"Weapons do not need to be shoot in order to cause losses," he said in his complaint.
Only two days before the case, Republican party candidate led the scandal to the presidential office, announcing people that the Second Amendment people, i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could take action if his rival was won by his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges.
Trump's campaign representatives said the media had broken his names from the context, and he never had any incitement to violence.
It wants to recover compensation from the campaign organisers for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines for attacks, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's spokesman Houpa Hikks did not make comments immediately.
It has not been possible to contact the Philippines.
The WCCB local news agency said that the Philippines had recently left the campaign.
It has also not been possible to call his consultancy's consultancy, "The Services Service Services."

A new tradition: the bleeding and sports festival in the village of Coal.
On Saturday, in the village of Club, we gathered for the first time on the bleeding and sports celebration.
After a ten-year celebrations, it was decided this time that there would be no more bicycles.
A new page has been transformed.
The day started with sporting competitions.
This time, the race was not traditional in nature and too serious because, for example, the horrors had to be met in the sleeping goal, the boat, the man left with the man's hand, the bumper of the bombings, had not had any Olympic Games at all.
However, each member was able to show how strong, courageous, successful and representative he was.
After sport, everyone gathered in an open-air service where the festive celebrations started.
In the meantime, the "corner of the child" was also in operation, where the small could climb in the excavated excavation and get a new image in a little face.
A novelty that could become a tradition was a toolkit for a toolkit of tractors and motorcycles.
Inga Chestham, who had wished recreation and dry time, was all too raining, but it was unable to obstruct anything.
The trees continued with the population of the youngest population in Cockery.
Indeed, it is good that the light has been accompanied by five girls and one boys.
Poguers from Engures, who won the Prince of Engures, were the beautiful magazine's "Ruden rites," who won the audience, who had a fine for the club.
And it's nothing that you're going to sleep on the wet scene.
Of course, the indigenous people and villages were the famous actuarial duplicary, Janis Jarana, and the Dainis Porgants, who once again once was the Mildian Nabina and the clear Crimean, as well as the wives of Berzina, who were found by the fishermen's day of 'Days'.
The Bruciis played the award.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only boost prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also in the whole country.
This, in my opinion, is making Hishthy very attractive, as in the case of 2012 in London, where we made an enormous amount of work, so that all the regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
The kitchen and the Byzal won a great deal of the Olympic Games.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the area of Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global failure.
The kicks were wrong for 2012 and they will not be right in the case of Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Hishava has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth amounting to 211 billion, leading to employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow works in an excellent team that has created an investment programme of 11 billion pounds of pound, entered in time and in the budget from 5 to 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years, and finally to the terminal 2, built between the two more intense scraps in the world.
They are now prepared to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics was a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and to expand Hishler, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain can be proud.

In Switzerland, a woman turned on the road by trying to commit suicide.
There was a big night in the middle of the night.
The police is trying to find witnesses in an accident when they crossed several cars on the road early in the morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday, shortly after midnight on A1 near the town of Morch near the town of Vo.
The police report says that a desperate wish to commit suicide was desperate for a woman to go down the road in a dark way.
Clearly, by trying to kill themselves, the victims, 49 years old, travelled several cars, including the heavy machinery.
She died at the scene.
Many of the drivers involved in the accident have already given testimonies, while others have not yet clarified, say the police, who are calling for the involvement of involved drivers and witnesses.
A criminal investigation has also been launched, which is a logical step in this case, by a lawyer, Gilles Hofstellers, who was ordered by Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any drivers will be penalised.
Was it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstellers added: 'This will be clear to the public prosecutor'.
The two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone down the road in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not envisage a pedestrian in the middle of the night, a pedestrians, the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman was acquitted for killing behind the neglect when she travelled in August 2014 to a man who was wearing the A1 road in the middle of the night near Payer erne.
It was clear to the Court that a 22 year old victim was drunk and later noticed to sleep on the road.
The Court concluded that a policeman travelling to the site of the accident travelled in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and that the judge admitted that the person in question on the road was on the road "completely unpredictable and exceptional."
Anyone with information on Thursday's accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are collected on the Internet for the appointment of a new head of the Revenue Service.
"Avaaz.org," the petition, launched a signature for the vacant post of the head of the State Revenue Service's head, Avaaz.org.
A petition addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (Greens / Farmers) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional recruitment process.
The petition was set up on August 10 and currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating the chief of the Revenue Service's chief, Inga Kolegova, is opaque and unprofessional.
This recalls the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again makes society disillusioned in government and politics.
"There needs to be a contest with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," said the petition.
He pointed out that the Society did not have the criteria for a post chosen by Kolegova.
Nor does it be clear what the candidate in the Revenue Service is to do.
According to the petition, the State Chancellery should develop a new, open competition, which will actively address professional candidates, personnel selection specialists and adequate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola was officially appointed head of the Revenue Service last week, the government said earlier this week, but all ministers of Unity party voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, then I was bad.
Meanwhile, Alexander Samoilovs and Janis Sterins hoped for the award at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, but there is no difference to the competition, according to Samoilovs.
One of the most powerful beaches of the world's beach champions, 1: 2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15) lost their guns and Pee Solbergam in the last four games.
In the three-group match, Latvian sportspeople won one win, but the same ratio was still two.
Latvia's top three points were the three smaller points of the couple, which were the worst hit by Latvian duplicate in the first half of the match.
"We were in the lead in the first six, but from 16: 15 it stayed to 16," Strelins said.
I do not even know how the remaining part of the sixth left left without a point.
It must not be.
Then it was in order in the second six, and it was a good thing to break the game in the face and it should have been a good foundation for the third sixth.
We started in the same way, but after we changed the parties, the result was only one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the group group, all the teams were similar, nearly all of them had three faces, so small points were important.
"It was a bit like that, rather than having 3-4 points in a row," he said.
We knew that Evane could feed it.
"The first six in the first round of the game, the second tranche of 1-2 points, and the third on + 4, went to him."
We tried to show the best game.
They came at a little while I was not.
The overall assessment situation before the mask was not seen, but it was known that there were as many small points as possible.
"If we lost bad then bad," Samoilovs said.
Evane waited a good man from Evane, and I've got it quite well in the first six, but the third was open for him and it was difficult to attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistake in making a mistake, precisely to Pee, but it has had to be dealt with.
Samoilovs said that, contrary to the previous match, the athletes had no nervousness today.
"We did, we did, but protection was better," he said.
"They played a good game and came back to the back at the end."
Before the tournament immediately said, the logo is the most inconvenient as it could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even from the group.
"All of us waited for the medal and we also had ourselves from ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25 or fourth," said Samoilovs, who predicted that the pair will continue to play together in the future as well.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one Turd.
Samoilovam in the Rio de Janeiro was in the third place of the Olympic game since he was in Beijing in 2008 with the Marshi Palace, but four years ago in London, he played together with Ruslanu Sorokina.
Meanwhile, this was the second start in the Olympic irony.
Latvia is also following the opening up of the gas market from the point of view of potential dealers.
Latvian energy company Latvijas energo follows the opening of the gas market from both the consumer and the potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, a company spokesman for the company.
"The decision on whether the future of the gas market will be added to the gas market as a trader will be determined by the design of the gas market model and the legal framework."
"This is why we are playing an active role in the drafting and comment of the legislation and we are tabling our proposals," said Bidere.
The BNS already wrote that the Economic Ministry (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulation Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gaze, developed the Cabinet of Ministers' draft rules "Provisions on the marketing and use of natural gas" which will change the existing principles for the functioning of the natural gas market, ensuring the free choice of natural gas to natural gas users from 3 April 2017.
In its work on the new regulation on the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the process of trade in natural gas as simple as possible and comprehensible to the user.
As the most effective and user-friendly solution, therefore, the "dealer's central model" is chosen as the most effective and user-friendly solution, where all the operations relating to customer service are provided by the trader, one contract, one invoice and one information and client place, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system under the responsibility of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
Reminds that a gradual opening up of the market to household customers - including after April 3, 2017 - for household customers who do not wish to choose another natural gas dealer will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the current trader at a regulated price, thus becoming users.
"In that case, the obligation to supply natural gas users at a regulated price is determined by the public trader," the ministry informed.
In turn, economic operators will have to choose a natural gas dealer to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Up until the conclusion of a commercial trade agreement for certain periods, the natural gas trade will be provided at a certain price for the natural gas dealer.
The draft regulation lays down detailed rules for the rights and obligations of the natural gas dealer, the system operator and users.
The rules set out the modalities for the supply of natural gas to users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of a recognised asset to the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for settlement of the received services, the level of interest for late payment, the arrangements for switching traders and the supply of customers in case of disruption of natural gas supply.

On Thursday, the value of the US dollar grew against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.

The turnover of the conservative producer Zil laugh is 33. 8% last year.
The company's overall turnover last year was EUR 4.202 million, which is 33. 8% less than a year ago, while the company lost 5.7 times - EUR 904,7 000, according to the annual financial statement published by Lursoft in the database.
The company's management report shows that in 2015 the company worked losses due to a number of reasons, including a persistent lack of assets due to the departure of the Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating the previously existing credit line and leaving the "Blue Belt" contracts without any possibility of execution.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a discount.
The departure of the bank from the Latvian market has also prevented the company from carrying out projects of support from the European Union's structural funds, which would have allowed the production plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Equally, the company's financial creators have been negatively affected by the rise in prices of raw materials in the past year and the consumer's reluctance to pay more for products manufactured by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price developments and were prepared to buy goods for new - higher prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, the "Blue Belt" started discussions with potential investors, including the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have familiar and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development had a positive impact on the life of the 2014 and 2015 restructuring and optimisation plans.
This plan involved improving and optimising technological processes in order to achieve greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of installations that offer higher production speeds were bought," the company's management said.
The management of the "Blue Belt" indicates that the equipment bought in 2016 will allow the company to execute orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of products produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since there are already signatory protocols on the sale of a product, all the manufactured products will be sold in accordance with the declarations of intent.
The new product increases the turnover of around EUR 300 000 per month, "the company's management said.
In August 2016, the company is also planning to sign a Cooperation Agreement for the supply of fish products to Iraq.
In 2015, the first experimental container to Israel has been sent to Israel, extended to Cyprus, and a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States will be signed in September this year.
As a result of all the measures mentioned above, the company intends to increase its turnover.
In 2014, a total of €6.347 million of turnover and €5.113 million in losses worked with the Blue lake.
'Blue lacking 'is established in 1994 and its principal capital is EUR 1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private individuals - Mikilam Kaidanovam (89. 11%) and Igor Shirshons (10. 89%).
You are invited to the film: 15 in a museum to wait for the film at Zars Leanderi and participate in a press conference.
The Riga Cinema is considered to be the beginning of a career at the Cinema of Zar Leanderes and inspired by the city.
The village of Zar Lye near the mother of Rit, who was a Swedish Ambassador in Latvia, in Latvia, in Riga in 1924, was in the hands of the woman of Zar Leanderes in 1924, because it was she who had found an unusual plot of the Zar Leanderes woman, which she had attempted to overturn on the pocket at the theatre theatre.
Perhaps it was precisely the random configration in Riga that became the fatal turn in the creative way of Zar, towards the world's bride.
Riga Leandeat was associated with warm memories by Riga Leandest and she hoped to return to Riga at the headquarters, but unfortunately these hope was not to be filled, because the Second World War started.
The meeting will be open to Riga by the great Nova Kerevica in Riga, by using the appearance of a show, and will become the great driver of the great Zar Leandee.

The insurer pays compensation to passengers in the airport on Wednesday.
If the insurance paid to a family of travel insurance has been paid for by a family of the flight cancelled on Wednesday 10 August, which had to be renounced for visiting the planned visitor Festival.
On 11 August, there was an application for compensation to be received from a client from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since this was not possible on Wednesday, due to flights cancelled at the airport, the customer had been compensated for the booking of accommodation for accommodation, which could not have been lifted, as well as the purchase of the festival of EUR 204 million tickets.
On the other hand, the money spent on airline tickets has promised customers to pay the airline.
If, on average, insurance cover for all travel insurance has been paid on average 15% of all travel costs have been paid out for interrupting or revoking a journey.
"Such times, the costs of purchasing, letting or exchanging tickets as well as about the accommodation of accommodation are reimbursed," the director of an insurance insurance product, DagJune Rutka, said in a statement.
As we know, on 10 August, at Riga Airport, a private aeroplane stopped a private aeroplane, so that several departing flights had been cancelled, while several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
As a result of the repair, the man is being buried in the caps and forced to leave their homes.
Dmitry Saidysv, whose neighbour launched the capital repair in his home apartment, has since lost a defeat and since Dmitry has been cut off from his caps, Dmitry Saidyv said.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and have been damaged in my apartment.
I then informed the Riga City Board, the house governoror and other organisations.
The board of directors said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner must go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert there," Dmitry said.
The guest expert arrived, shook events and admitted that the overlap was in a state of unsatisfactory condition.
However, since the first Dmitry application, one month has passed on the site, and until the beginning of this week, it was also unable to answer whether there is no life-threatening presence.
It was legislation, wait if you are not happy, writes all in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager again to the construction board and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
It is clear, after all paper blends, that the construction works have been stopped, even if they can be heard from time to time.
During two months of having to carry out the expertise, all these defects would have to be prevented within six months.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal complex in this current structure is affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the subsistence subsistence is present at risk.
"This is why we have asked for further clarification from this expert," Ilze Jack, spokesman for the Riga City Board, said.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper house, it is still heard that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without construction permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a particular case, the fine may be more severe.
Pending an expert opinion, the Board of Governors decided that both apartment should not be operated, whether in the case of construction works or in the Dmitry apartment.
"This is not a case in practice for the board of construction boards where, as a result of this knowledge, or simply because of an unwillingness, citizens may have created a risk not only in their ownership but also in the sub-prime owner of the property, as a result of which the owner cannot exploit his property," the representative of the board of the building board told.
Dmitry is now refusing to find another place where to live - to relatives, friends, hotels or to rent other houses.
But Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbouring civil legal area, which can take a lot of time.
As a result of the arbitrary construction, both live in their lives are currently banned until the construction of the building engineers, which may have to wait three weeks.
The loss of life will have to be borne by the owner of an apartment in which repair work occurred.
The owner of this apartment is therefore in prison for a period of up to six months.

NASA climate model: Venera once inhabited planet
On the basis of the latest climate models of the NASA, Venera once was an inhabitable planet.
Scientists from the NASA Godarda Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the history of the Venera, using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate-scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venerne, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, has had conditions like the Earth.
Scientists have said in advance that Venera's slow speed at the cutting is explained by the density of the atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venera once had a plan, a earth similar to the earth and slow slowly.
The Model also looks at the former topography of Venera.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on the Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity in order to be able to develop life and prevent the evaporation of water.
In the early days of Vencoma, the sun was 30 per cent.
The WISS model simulation model reveals that the daylight of the day to 2 months, GISS Anl Del Genio said in a press release.
This process warns the planet's surface and gives rise to a case that, in turn, is a beautiful layer of clouds operating as an umbrella, shielding the planet from the heat of the sun.
As a result, temperate temperatures are emerging, which is, in fact, a few degrees below the ground for Earth today.
The Modelis is presented by the history of Venera, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in its hypothesis.
Although it was once populous, in several billion years, Venera has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet races.
Its oceans evaporate and the garbs burned down ultraviolet rings.
The water is completely empty, it is only the carbon climate of the plan with a lethal greenhouse gas - the Venera as we know it today.
Scientists published the new results of the new VenLiberysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrtime Roy resigned on Avalanche coach
Mr Patrik Roy, coach of Avalanche, coach and vice-president of the Hockey Operation, issued a remark on Thursday, citing the lack of impact on the team decision-making process.
He said that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been vigorously, enthusiastically and resolutely carrying out my duties as the chief coach and vice-president of the Colorado club," he said in a statement.
I have much thought during this summer how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the necessary splendid and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the chief coach and the Hockey Operations vice-president must be fully aligned with the organisation's visas.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning team-performance.
At present, these conditions have not been met.
He thanked Roy for his investment in his team, who was hired on 23 May 2013.
He said that Mr Patrwas informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the good of the organisation and wish him well in the future.
In his first season with Avalanche, Roy was named the best coach coach in 2013-2014.
He helped to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Divisions, while the club had not been locked up for two years in the first round of the exit match.
The Avalanche closed the season for the 2015-2016 season with 39-39-4 and left five points behind Wild, without the second special call from the Western Conference organisers.
Roy, who won the Canadiens and two with the Avalanche, has won four games in the Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
The workers in the North Sea oil platform restart negotiations and postpone the strike

Periodic to the oil processing company Wood Group, strikes on the North Sea oil platforms, where the Royal Dutch Shell company operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of the Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week with a view to revising the issues raised.
The trade unions said that their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are against a planned wage cut of 30 per cent.
As a result of the negative market pressures of the market, the 'Wood Group' has reduced salaries for those working in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced its wages by 10 percent.
The company is making clear that the additional wage cuts would enable the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell has already reduced salaries for thousands of people and announced plans to end the oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparation for a major merger with a British energy company BG group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of their falling oil prices, and the situation is more complicated by the British decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish MP, Deivs Andersons, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues, the North Sea stress plans.

In 2016, nearly USD 1.4 billion is planned for new North Sea projects, compared to the $7 billion invested over the past five years.
The star of the star's star star is called a star in the star.
The latest Caper Telescopy mission has helped astronomer to summarise the most complete catalogue for the speed of the star's star in the star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the star in this star at different speeds, as well as the way in which the star ceiling applies to the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results with other star star, we will get more information about the links between the mass, age and even the history of the snow," the news news news said.
The star of the platform is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many star star in this star is only starting to rise to around 125 million years.
They shall be converted with a maximum speed.
With maximum speed, this growing star is released by a large number of star star wind.
When it comes to the star in the magnetic field of the star, they are stopping star.
In the ageing of the stars, their cutting speed is decreasing.
The King of each star is measured by the time between the appearance of the recognisable star areas such as solar plantains.
The most recent catalogue of star cutting rates shows that more star star is slower than smaller star.
The rubble compares the star with the deserts, the larger growth dances are made by the piretes slower than small fruit dwellers.
The rubble tells us that the "ballant" is "bigger and more mass," while more and more rotating objects are very small star.
Due to the fact that the platform is so close to the platform, it serves as a wonderful space laboratory where the characteristics of the star with the cutting speed can be compared.
The rubbish star is helping to create theoretical models of star star on both directions for older and younger stars.
We still have a great deal to learn how, when and why it will slow the speed of the star's cutting and the full process of cutting back on it.
He and his colleagues presented in detail the speed analysis of the cutting of the star star in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journomy Journary.
