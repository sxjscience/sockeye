A 28-year-old goalkeeper found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old boardroom, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found in a stairs of a supermarket.
But the victim 's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to overturn his brother, saying: 'His life finally started to improve'.
The official, who was found at the Westphaled supermarket on Wednesday, was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco Galicia, said a member of the San Francisco Medical Expert Office.
The San Francisco police said his death was considered a murder and an investigation is under way.
Luiss Galicia told the San Francisco broadcaster ABC KGO that he had previously worked as a pause in Boston, but six months ago he had been working for his dream work in Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
The Sons & Daughters restaurant said he was shocked and shocked by the news of his death.
"We are a small team working as a cohesive family and we will miss him very much."
In these difficult times, we will be thinking with the friends and family of Mecca.
Luiss Galicia says he was naked in the hosts at the beginning, but the life has finally improved recently.
"He came in a new apartment and met a girl," Luiss told the radio station KGO.
Luiss Galicia says he does not know who would like to go beyond his younger brother.
He was a good man with a great heart.
"He always wasted his family preparing a mental meal and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"In view of everything that has gone wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond who died bright every day," he says.
Anyone with information about what has happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Tel 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: calling for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade unions to initiate protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The committee of New Doctors of the British Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to ask the Council to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
The JAC considers that ministers have failed to address any doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
58% of all the members who took part in the vote voted against the Treaty.
JAK Council member Elēna Makkorta says the government continues to remain silent on this issue and has therefore rejected the offer.
She said: 'Against this background, as a result of the JAC vote, the treaty proposal has been completely rejected and the decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues'.
In response to the government 's silence, JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the drafting of new contracts that would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS 's history.
After the vote rejecting the treaty conditions proposed by the LMA, which was recommended by the BMA, LMA 's young doctor Dr Johans Malawana resigned.
Prior to his meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
He said the contract would be concluded with English mediators after the vote.
Russia and Turkey: Excluded alliance?
Richard Freedman who ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to meet and announce the end of the eight-month war on names and economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin 's welcome to the Turkish leader at the St Petersburg Castle gave the impression that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However, the two routed.
Vladimir Putin 's smile seemed grounded and did not provoke heated emotions, even in light of his usual reticence.
On the other hand, Mr Tayip Erdogan called Putin his "dear friend" at least five times, according to the meeting.
I felt the number.
He also said that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would be even stronger.
The following day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm leads to contradictory feelings.
However, the radiation storm from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he referred to in his address was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted sharply then.
Putin accused Ankara that it had inspired an anger in the back of Moscow.
The transfer was all the more painful given that it came from a friend 's side.
Restoring genuine confidence will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russia 's public position has changed since November.
For several months, government controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious was the accusation that the Erdogan family itself has made profits from the illegal trade in oil with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied this.
However, the key message of the St Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting happened only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a sort of victory.
The benefits of the Ankara peace settlement are obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends following the failed coup last month in which he was attempted to overthrow.
The numerous terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There is also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused considerable damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which typically bring in millions of Russian tourists into Turkish resort every year.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russia 's fans and charter companies were also relieved in the airstrikes when regular flights are restored.
They are hoping for a fever holiday in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the country 's TV provides for a drop in the price of fruit and vegetables, as imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quots, 'Tourists for them, tomatoes for us'.
But the visit also had other political motives on the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry to the West for a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
Everything can also be seen as frustrating the long-standing EU accession negotiations and Putin 's intervention, which is happy to take advantage of the situation of Turkey alienating from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the attempted coup.
Take note that Moscow understands this well, because it is deeply rooted in fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxury castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the 'excluded alliance', the two countries that feel excluded from the West were joining forces.
However, despite publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main controversy concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a means of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations without wishing to disclose information, both Presidents stated at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries can find common ground on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes, when a member of NATO shot down a Russian battlefield by Turkey, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The flag will henceforth play a supporting role, the CEO said.
Outside Scotland, the ICB will no longer be available.
Ross Mcevan told the BBC Canal in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank 's ambitions on a global scale.
It has relinquished these ambitions, because eight years ago the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts in the branding strategy have used the ICB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from the rugby of the Seimas Nations to Wimbleton tennis champion Endy Mureum.
Now, however, it has been decided to bring other national brands to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Wales, all references by the ICB, outside the central office and the official stock exchange list, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt 's Military Bank, will now also take note.
He was interviewed during a trip with customers and staff in Inverneshire.
He told the BBC Scottish Canal: "The ICB will become the brand of our investors and with whom our staff work, because we are now more than a brand bank."
In the meantime, the Bank itself became a global brand and the ICB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions; we have local ambitions.
Each brand will represent something unique in its sector and our employees will work under these brands.
The SKB has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have been asking ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?"
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and would develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of the customers, not on our own needs, we have obviously made a major change.
We can revitalise these brands, so I think that now is the time.
Drivers win 3000th, first in New York with a horse Predilection
The prophets corrupt the champagne, winning their 30th victory twice by finalising their first race in Newcastle.
A 30th victory in Britain 's history was won by Jockey-Quix Detors on Friday, winning the first place in New Jerusalem.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in his home town in the Predilection, which was coached by John Gorence.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jokeyball who has reached the end of the horse races.
He has joined Seram Gordon Ričardsam, Dougam Smitam, Lester Pigota, Karl Edery and Willi Karson.
The tripartite champion Jockey Deters, who previously won the horse with the horse Ghayyar, said: 'This is something special'.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this was the case in New Jerusalem, because I have been here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not a Royal Askota, but an ordinary evening on Friday, together with 20 000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
The Detors and the Predilection are expected to win with applause and light.
The two fighters have reached the same record in the hot spotlight - Ričards Johnson and the 20-time career champion Sir Antonry McCanuy, who have put many record record in their career, winning more than 4,300 victories.
Lesters Pigots, the nine-time winner, won 4493 wins in his career.
Saxony is one of the best jackets of our times and it is not surprising that he has achieved success only rarely.
He is fierce and strong, but his sense of tactics separates him from other fighters.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charism are attracting fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I said at the Epsoma Games that he would have won 6 000 victories if he did not just take part in the weekend and had a big race.
However, to be serious, it is a real pleasure that Yukky has been winning the UK race on a regular basis for 30 years.
He is a thoughtful boycott that is fantastic in the British race and he is an excellent jokey.
The Detors noted this achievement with their firm 's brand, the fly leap.
From finishing at wind speed to the airswing, Barkium Deters has been a British horse racing face for twenty years.
This has been an adventitious road.
He has won numerous grand races, including the famous 'Grand Seventh Researcher' in Askota in 1996, and survived a plane crash and a disqualification about the use of preparations.
Three years ago he had difficulty returning after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his nature by challenging those who questioned him when returning to his best form.
And he could be on the floor for some time - Deters have said in advance that he would be happy to stay in the race at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the circle of Putina 's closest people for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed as Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the work of the head of the Russian presidential administration," without giving any reason.
Mr Antons Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed to replace Ivanova.
The 44-year-old Vaino has been awarded a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, graduated from Moscow 's National Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
According to Kremlin 's website (in Russian), he later headed the Presidential Protocol and the administration of government staff.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: 'Thank you for your confidence'.
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the State in drawing up the law and in monitoring the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov wished to leave office and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Are we persuading smiles?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a Finn and close to Vladimir Putin 's ally and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service at the KGB.
He was one of the most influential husbands in Russia.
In a hearing broadcast on state television, both men said that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But, despite the smiles of the cameras, rarely it is convincing, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official claim that a man who was considered a possible president suddenly wanted to be the leader of Russia 's environmental policy is received with great scepticism.
In the remark published on the Kremlin homepage, Ivanov says to Putin: 'It is a fact that, in early 2012, I asked you to entrust this difficult post, I could even say a problematic one, four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB 's National Security Service, like Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov held the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusts most.
At the end of the second term, Putin was regarded as a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as Putin 's re-election for the third term would be unconstitutional.
At that time, however, another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became President.
Putin became Prime Minister and after three and a half years came back to office.
Arrival of pelagic fish in a garden in Banfas
One man from Banfas is asking for help to find out the conditions in which species of fish have appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sandwich boys who have fled the water.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres from the sea, published a video on the fish website in Periscope, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimetres of fish were going into his garden.
Intersection of the queauxury: the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The €1.35 billion project is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Indians have connected the northern part and viaduct of the crossings of the Kwine-Farm, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing its conclusion.
The flat-bridge structure is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 aid for cables.
The €1.35 billion project is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keits Brauns was today on the road to construction and was one of the first to walk to the bridge.
He said: 'This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Sofia Bridge'.
In this project, we are seeing an unrivalled engineering solution, with more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel being used only for the construction of this part.
Regardless of the huge weight and size of the bridge, bridges and viaducts are an extremely delicate process that requires huge precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge has already been constructed and the final link linking the bridge to Rositu will be included today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be included.
Michael Martin, Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project, says: 'The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge'.
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the construction of the top-class civilisation.
After the last road section has been installed and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we have been left to connect the northern road to the ground part, or viaduct.
This was done by moving part of the northern entry viadute to 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very sensitive operation.
It is immense because the viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs about 6 000 tonnes and had to pull around 3%.
It was delicate because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, it all worked well.
Simona Bailsa is making a golden exercise for women.
Conflicts have been extinct.
There has been anxiety.
Simmon Bailsu is not all concerned about this.
Dynamically slow.
Efforts are being exerted unintentionally on the beam.
Unbeat the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic Games.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American vignette won a golden medal, showing a complete distinction between itself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total number of points was 62.198 above the result of the silver medal and her teammate, Alia Raismane, and the Russian athletes Alia Mustafinas, winner of the bronze medal.
Simona Bailsa was on Thursday in the U.S. Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailas became the fourth American man in a row after winning the most successful champion and the fifth best player in the history of his generation 's champion.
When the end result was announced, she came out in tears because the long road was over there.
This achievement ranks him alongside unrivalled sportspeople such as Michael Felps, who raised his sport at another level.
Bailas has dominated its sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 golden medals, fulfilling a combination of excellent, precise and ambitious exercise that the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lu Retone, described him as the "best player she ever saw."
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes placed on her, not with the rest of the athletes.
She would be frustrated if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without golden medals.
Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane envy after winning athletes of gold and silver medals, respectively, at the individual finals of the crowd in the summer 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailsa won the first golden medal on Tuesday, making Marta Karolji 'lead-off for a special ranking coordinator.
Although Bailas claims that it was not expected to do so on its long road to the notwithstanding, it is not true.
Some of her forward-looking movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music fitting in the street alongside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still a baby and was discovered by the mother of the tree Eymy obstetric on the sports tournament where Burman 's Xinjiang took place, has now become the force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost the number of fights since the summer of 2013 and the series of victories can continue as long as Bailasa wants it.
Although the Mustafina 's two rotations were a little ahead, it was only an illusion.
The beam and the free movement part of the competition, where Bailas will defend his championship, are still ahead of us.
She led the way with a result of 15.433 on a beam and strengthened her leadership through a free movement of 15.933.
Raismane poisoned her mildly while she waited for results that were merely formality and were released into the tears of joy when the dream that she had once wrote in her note book.
Raisman 's result was a slight retaliation over four years of events, when she divided third place with Mustafin, but lost the battle for the medals.
This time, the 22-year-old captain, what the Americans call 'grandmother', came to the forefront of convincing leadership.
After the performance of the free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate her to the crowd of the aircrafts.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bailas virtual Twitter record, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
The 6-year-old Mahai Brauns 'bullet hole' lives on fire in Philadelphia.
Police said the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, saying it was already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
A child 's grandparents, the CBS Filadelphia news channel, confirmed that this was Mahajas Brauns.
The grandparents say that Braun was shot several times, including in a circus, in a wedding, in a hand and in a garden, but there was still consciousness when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Deloresa Melendeza, was told television: 'His little body was simply clothed with bullets'.
I cannot believe that.
A boy in a critical situation has been hospitalised and several operations have already been carried out.
The family says he will certainly recover.
He had to start first class at local primary school.
Braun is one of four people who were shot in the town of Jermantaun.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Filadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-olds is in a critical situation, while the other two are in a stable situation.
The channel tells us that the child was found in the front seat of the machinery next to the 29-year-old victim in a critical situation.
The other two were not in the car and police were investigating whether any of them were attacked.
The prosecutor told CBS Filadelphia that a number of shooters were likely to be involved in the shooting.
The patrons of weapons belonging to different weapons have been discovered at the scene.
It seems to have been a long-lasting shelling.
There are shells on both sides of the pedestrian pavement.
"As a result, there seem to be a number of armed shooters here who actively participated in the shooting," Philadelphia police captain Antonijs Ginskis said.
Several homes and cars were also damaged.
No one has yet been detained and police are reported to check the records of surveillance cameras.
The bullet hit a 6-year-old girl in the hand during the shelling on Tuesday, while she was playing in front of her home in the area of Weststoukleina.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simona, Gabon and Lauria?
I call it the Women 's Olympics of the year for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been for all the summer Olympic Games since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team includes three lightlands, Simona Bailsa, Gabija Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, which inspire many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that Alija Raismane, who is a Jewish and Medison Kohl, who is a Catholic, is also part of this team.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best vigour has been the Americans of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabon ranked 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabiy Duglah, surprisingly, became the Olympic champion and America was lucky.
Now the world has seen incredible exercise by the triple world champion Simona Bailsa, Duglas and Laurija Hernandeza, making unprecedented but meistarable exercise.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American man in a row who has won a golden medal in an individual struggle for women.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country the situation in the exercise hours is completely different.
Simona, Gabon and Lauria entered the Olympic Selection in the same way as Alihia and Medison.
They are the 'Olympic Five', because there will be only four athletes in the next Olympic Games, and this is the third year of Marta Karol.
In fact, the exercise is expensive for sport, with cartels being mainly trained in private, light-golden clubs and kept by parents paying for training, accommodation, travel, formastery, hotels (coaches, sportspeople and their families) and other expenditures.
Most of these light Latin clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their training, and this is a costly and long-lasting contribution to lightweight families.
Eimia Burman - training for Simonas Bailas and Megija Hainija - Laurie Hernandez coach has trained her athletes since the two girls began to deal with lightweight.
We must provide young girls who inspire Simona, Gabon and Lauria with cheaper opportunities for exercise training.
I founded my light-Latin organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is in Harare, and we offer more than 15,000 full-time training for young people, mainly black and Spanish, for free or at low cost, and we have also coached national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my home city) to give local young people the opportunity to get to know this excellent sport.
Easiercely develops the coordination of forces, localities and the body, as well as teaching hard work, discipline and aiming for purpose.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to teach in light and it is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this kind of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simona, Aliyna, Gabon and Medison for their excellent demonstration of the Metal Force, in gaining gold medals from the Olympic Games and in motivating countless young girls from different backgrounds to become healthy, healthy and successful young women.
After the rejection of James Hanta 's offer, young doctors are planning more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by agreeing to change the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hant announced plans to conclude the contract, indicating that NHS is in a precarious state and that further delays will only be to the detriment of workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new treaty to change the conditions for night work and weekends in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, BMA 's young doctor, Dr Elēna Makourta, said that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, especially that it will exacerbate the crisis in the labour force and it does not impose equal conditions on all doctors.
Eight weeks away until the first group of young doctors sign the new treaty, so progress has to be made, because there is not much time left.
The BMA 's efforts to solve the problem through negotiations have been faced with a lack of willingness on the part of the government, sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened despite the fact that, just last month, James Hant said that his doors were always open.
James Hanta must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with young doctors.
If he does not, the young doctors are prepared for new protests.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and advisers were trying to replace doctors who had gone into the picket.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work at weekend for 54,000 new doctors covered by new contracts.
The NHS Employment Executive Director, Daniels Mortimers, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on burdened workers and worry, cause stress and hindrances for patients, carers and their families.
We have been talking to the new doctor committee over the past two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about the custodians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other key issues such as the placement of workers, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender inequality in medicine - show that employers, English health institutes and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have a heart attack could be treated for 2 pounds a day because official representatives recommend their use for more people and for longer periods.
The anti-retardation drugs Ticagrelor reduce the risk of repetition of hearts to people with cardiac.
These medicines are already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of repetition.
NICE, represented by NHS, recommends the use of this preparation 4 years after its heart in order to further reduce the risk of hearts for people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE, currently under NHS 's responsibility, recommended the use of this preparation 4 years after its heart in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular risks.
Every year, around 140 000 people in England are going through a heart attack, and a quarter of them are going through a rehearsal or insult.
Carriers and insults are caused by the accumulation of fat in heart walls for dam purposes.
If the dam bursts, it can create a thromba, block the flow of blood to the heart and provoke a heart attack.
If the thrombs are separated from the wall of blood, it can get further into the blood and block access to the brain, causing infarchet.
People who have been heartfelt are at greater risk of a repeat heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name of Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombasm formation.
The new NICE Guidelines, published today, recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years by 60 mg on a daily basis with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsona, the NICE Health Technology Director, explains: "Despite having access to medicines to prevent a repetition of the heart, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart are experiencing another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences."
Fear from repeated hearts may have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of repetition of heart and heart attack to people who have already experienced it.
By prematurely recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to see that we can increase the treatment opportunities for thousands of people, who are therefore winners.
Given the limited information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bloodshed when using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used beyond this deadline.
A culture of political correctness stimulates electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurs Rahmans, the former mayor of Tauerhamleta, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickll criticises the police, electoral monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the electoral process, for "fear harassment of ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at the election stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present an identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
He even recommended the designation of the votes of the electorate with a special ink in order to avoid double voting.
News also need to provide more protection, says Sir Eric.
He considers that the press should provide greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it'.
The report was commissioned by Dauningstrite after a scandal in connection with the election of the people of Tauerhamleta.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled to remove Lutfuru Rahmanu, mayor of the city, as a result of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced its critics on charges of racism and Islam.
"Rahman has conducted his election campaign in which it is the religious duty of religious believers to vote for him."
Around 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also says that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud in the postal vote, in which older members of the Muslim communities had forced others to vote for candidates they wanted, was particularly worrying.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to establish a person 's identity.
His report says: 'Evidence suggests that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote in favour of the community 's oldest selected candidates, especially in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities'.
"It is feared that the regional authorities are not turning attention to these problems for reasons of political correctness, as they might be prejudicial to ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on the use of mail votes by political activists to prevent "votes" being gathered.
The report, examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent voter lists being used for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to produce an identity document before voting.
To mark the fingers of the elected electorate with a special ink in order to avoid double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons in order to make sure that the person is entitled to vote.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Banning political campaign members and activists from using mail and ballot ballots to vote by post.
Providing the police with powers to appoint guards to the polling stations.
Modification of the law to make it easier to prosecute individuals for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
No photograph at polling stations.
Establish a requirement to use only English (except in Wales) at polling stations.
Increasing training to ensure that polling people go to the ballot box.
Sir Eric criticizes the Metropolitan police for failing to understand that the Tauerhamlet case has not been prosecuted.
He says: 'The Electoral Court only disqualified Lufturu Rahmanu and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud'.
He was categorically found guilty of a standard of criminal justice evidence based on unscrupulous evidence.
He also criticizes the inefficient "sweep" of voters at the polling stations in the city council.
Sir Eriks says: "The ruling of last year 's court is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the homeland of the parliament, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of the authorities that fraud is not a threat to this good repute.
Involvement of cyclists - Catholic accomplices and other associates of the Rio Olympic Games
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games are enthusiastic for French cyclists Paul Ferrandu Prevotu, who has been found extremely similar to hercogie of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old cyclists are not the only athletes to fight this summer for a golden, which, according to the media, is proud of its famous counterpart.
Therefore, on the occasion of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently being seen on our screens, the CorneAIL has set up a list of Olympic players which is quite similar to the Street Stars of Hollywood.
Hunger and wool: MP Breidium Coon, left, has been compared with Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood
Apart from Keit 's counterpart on the cycling trawl, many people on the Internet say that this bullet could be a superstar, Leonardo Di Kaprio 's twin brother.
Breidy Yukon, a member of the male amateur shot team, caused a storm on Twitter when he published photographs in which he is very similar to Wall Wall Wall Wilt.
The athletes also noticed the storm in social media and said he was compared with Leonardo Di Kaprio since his childhood.
"Personally, I do not see a great deal of similarity except for bardage," Breidium told Huffington Post.
"He 's a good shut, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, even more popular will undoubtedly be one of the most popular couples of the 2012 London Olympic Games: the staggering parity between the British farmer Gregu Ruterford and popular activist Petersburg Haris.
The lightweight of Russia, Alija Mustafina, is compared with Gloria Estefanu, an American singer of Cuban origin, thanks to its great, pronounced eyes.
As far as swimming is concerned, South Africa 's swimming Cameroon van der Burg has, for some years, been compared with the 'Creath for the Vision' star Metjuman Morison.
Change: This user has noticed that Nan is a sportical version of Inception 's actress.
Also, the ancient star Rafael Alexal and activist Jose Hartnet have similar eyes and frames.
Russian silver medal, swimming Julian Efimova and actress Annalina Makkorda are not only proud of the skin and the blonde hair in the sun, while the fans believe that the American athletes, Nan Adrians, are not just like Joseph Gordon Levitam.
Women in wars: Football stars (left) Houpai Srell and the serial "Nuresters" actress Jenifer Karpented (well) have a similar form and eyes.
No one: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities.
Theory: this user thinks there is probably a reason why both appeared as similar
Recently, a Twitter user said with great pleasure that "other internet users are in agreement that Houpa Srell and Jenifer Karpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. Football stars and the Cirule 's actress really have a very similar form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons relate to Kerry Yonging and her smile, which is almost identical to the smiles of Lauras Linia, a golden medallist of Gabiy Duglas proud of a beautiful, wide-ranging smile like Bring It On 's star, Bring Unijon 's smiles.
The CBC Olympic Interviewer apologises for his comment that the Chinese swimp was 'dead'.
Bairon Makdonalda 's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finies in fourth place on the 4x200 m freedom-style station for women, shouted a storm of indignation in the CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimming was "out of the competition, smelting" and "end up like a pig."
Component Bairon Makdonalds thought his microphone was excluded when 4x200 m of free playground for women set out their personal views at the end of the finals.
Makdonalds, who was included in the CBC commenting team in order to give life to his comments, said: 'It is the little 14 year-old Chinese incapable of keeping up with him'.
"Too crashed, she came out of the competition for an irritation and ended as a pig."
Thank you very much.
Ai Yanhana, a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, was 1: 57.79 in the second stage, 1.61 seconds less than the result of Canadian Teilores Ruckas, allowing the Canadians to catch up.
The viewers across Canada responded immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tones and expressions.
Emet Makfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the direct CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China" ended as a pig. "
It was not understood that they were still direct in the air.
Ai Yanha, of China 's 4x200m freedom-style finals, was named "a little fourteen-year-old Chinese unaccompanied."
The criticism against Bairon Makdonalda quickly came into force, as many were asking for clarification.
Users of Twitter were unable to believe by listening to Bairon Makdonalda 's insensitive comments.
User Sara Paradi wrote on Twitter: "Oho × ByronMacDonald.
For the sake of your representative, CBC and Canada and Tevis, we all sound like a racist.
Shortly after that, Scottish Racel, who led the CBC live broadcaster, apologised for the comments of Makdonalda, saying: 'We apologise that the comment on the swimming result was echoed in the direct air'.
This was the unfortunate choice of words and we regret that this was the case.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who responded to Twitter.
Makdonalda 's colleague, Scottish Rasela, had to apologise for his place.
The CBC then inaugurated more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Makdonalda 's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and they came straight to the air.
Yesterday we responded immediately and apologised to all viewers and followers on the social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon 's comments were made about the basher 's performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessful in choosing statements and Bairons deeply regrets what has happened.
On Thursday afternoon, Makdonalds personally apologised directly in the air and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be seen as a personal attack.
He said on-line at the CBC Olympics: "I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made yesterday after the women 's free-style competition."
I am talking about the bathers 'performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect and I really regret that this was the case.
The purchasers are shocked by a woman who is shamelessly bogged down in the middle of the subpolar shops.
The shoppers felt awkward when the woman started to jump up to the trouble in the middle of the shop.
By making the situation even worse, she took them to make sure that they stood up and then pulled her back on the shop shelf.
She went on looking for clothes at the Bouverie Place shopping centre and infused four more bicycles.
PrAlfrek 's Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Coukeston - the place where the woman was in the suburbs and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, there were also two children 's mother, Jenium Davidsone, who says that the unknown woman, after the time of the subsistence, wrote her clothes and left the shop with nothing to do with it.
She says people were unable to believe their eyes.
In the midst of the shop, she took her from the shelf 's subbikes, pulled her lakes and troubles and mapped them on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, she was just keeping them on the ground.
Everyone watched her wolves and apparently the woman did not like them because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more bicycles until she ruled she liked and left the shop.
It did not seem that he would be concerned that anyone would look or think about the person who would buy the clothes that she was admitting.
Davidson 's newspaper (33 years) from Kenya tells us: 'The idea is that one will buy clothes that have been bought by another person and that have not been washed afterwards'.
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson 's newspaper adds: 'I assume that the shop 's staff, after leaving her, removed the clothes from the shop shelves - which is also acceptable'.
I cannot imagine buying a new subservient and finding that another woman has grabbed them and has not been washed afterwards.
PrAlfrek 's representative pointed out that Præk was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The clothes in question have been removed from the shop shelves.
How to protect ourselves from firearms through Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in close proximity from guns, we spoke to Krav Maga 's Grand Master from New York Rona Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and take precedence over the attacker.
The mine states that if the attacker strikes from the back, then the first step must be to turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid a shot trajectory.
Then the weapon must be weighed between its predecessor and shoulder in the face of the opponent, with its free elite.
Then there was a washing through the circus and while the attacker sits, he should take a weapon, beat his face with a gun and step down while he continues to turn a weapon against him.
If the aggressor comes from the front, the situation is similar: shot trajectory must be avoided, weaponry shot and bullied in such a way that the perpetrator cannot be fired.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and a blow to the opponent in the clock and, finally, he must take a weapon and give up on his role.
It sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizraki is doing.
But remember if you do not have a Master of Krav Maga, it is safer to give your money back to the robbery.
The vandalist family is demolishing the social house of Saltah Kornvolas and is being put on the streets.
The family of the Germans has been evicted from their place of residence for the bullying of their neighbours, causing damage to the social home of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Šon Trebilkok, have been set off from property in Saltah Cornvolus because a number of complaints have been made about them.
When they were forcibly disposed of, the shocked housing services found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were wasted holes in the rubbish and walls, washed and walls covered with graffiti everywhere.
The family is now disbanded from property and is most likely to live in a private ownership.
Donna Makevoja, the head of the Cornvola Housing Service, says that there are fears that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She says that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live there.
A number of factors need to be considered in this case, as this property will no longer be of good repute in Kornvola.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
There were three sons who have been in possession periodically and police say that their terror manifested itself in the form of violence, belawing on the streets, bullying of the local population, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs, and beautiful bullying and motherhood.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was proprietary, was punished in June for anti-social behaviour.
A number of demolished houses of houses find wasted waste.
There are also several floor sons in the home where drugs can be marketed previously.
The neighbours are saying that they are routinely hungry on the streets and constantly being called the police.
The Cornvola Housing Service forced them out of their property when they had 11 weeks to move out of their homes voluntarily.
The desperate neighbours were very happy to evict, because their life was an absolute hell.
One said: 'They were not taken care of by other citizens'.
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been fragile.
It is incredible how often we have seen the police here.
We could not sleep this morning.
We wake up because there was so silent - we are not used to it!
Now that they are at last away, they will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatrik, who is head of the neighbourhood protection of the Cornvola Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called upon by the police.
Different old and unusable items were found in the arable garden of the home.
He also said: 'It is a pity that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because eviction is always the last step taken by the Cornvola Housing Service'.
This was a very complex case, because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbours have been very hard to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work of all my team, the Devón and Kornvola police and members of the Commonwealth who were brave and collaborated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrik said that all three sons had lived here during different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after eviction.
The service 's staff will now have to finance a waste plant left in the home.
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, weights, accessories and 1 700 pound in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of storing Class B drugs with a view to spreading them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son, Lies Scheldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After evictions, it has become known that they are renting a private property in Plyuta at the moment.
There were lots of graffiti on many walls in the house.
The police are saying that they will continue to put out Irish people who are in breach of their rent agreements.
Andžela Krova, a representative of the Dawon and Kornvolas police, says that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said: 'This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave like they want and will have no effect'.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour is unacceptable for the Dawon and Cronvola police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Resilience to spend can kick-start the economy.

The Mayor of Cannes has banned the burkini swimming beaches.
The mayor of Cannes in southern France has banned the wearing of the burkini swimming trees in the beaches of the city, which barely covers the woman 's body and is very reminiscent of the hydrochip, local officials said Thursday.
David Linar, Mayor of Cannes, has signed the order that 'access to beaches and swimming is forbidden for anyone who does not have a bathing chat that respects good custom and secularism' as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"The appalling chips that exhibit religious affiliations at a time when France and places of worship are targets for terrorist attacks can create the risk of disturbance to public order (glooming, collision, etc.) which needs to be addressed," the statement said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols in the beach, but about the wonderful clothes associated with the trust in terrorist movements that are waging with us."
He added that the burkini swimming at Cannes beaches had not been seen since July 28 when Linars, a member of the centre-right centre-right Yukans party, signed the order and came into force.
In Marseille this week, the acvity in Marseille put an end to a planned private event for Muslim women who would be burdened in swimming boxes because they were outraged by both right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France, wearing shadows of Muslim women is forbidden, but religious symbols or appropriate clothes are not forbidden.
85 people were killed on 14 July in a terror attack in Nice near Cannes, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.
On 26 July, two attackers who had shattered confidence in the Islamic State were brutally murdered a priest in a church in north-west France.
Jysk grown turnover by 5% last year.
Jysk 's household retailer Jysk Linnen 'n Furniture (Jysk) last year raised turnover of 5 percent to EUR 23.66 million, according to Firmas.lv.
The company 's turnover in 2014 was EUR 22.57 million.
The company 's profits also increased slightly, from EUR 781 235 in 2014 to EUR 785 896 last year.
The management report says that last year the company reconstructed the existing shop in Riga, the Slovak Street, and closed the store in Riga, the Kurzeme Prospectus.
This year, as for other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both its turnover and its profits.
In the meantime, the profits made last year are recommended to remain undistributed.
Jysk is an international chain of stores offering goods to get home.
Jysk Linnen 'n Furniture' was founded in 2001.
The company 's share capital is EUR 3 500 264.
The company belongs to Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC, a registered company in Iceland.

The "Cuba" festival started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, 11 August, the evening in Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals this summer - there will be 'Cuba' up until Sunday night.
In the first evening, groups such as Enter Shikari from Britain, which was expected last year but not to disappear, the American panels NOFX, DJ Maxim, the Prodigy group and others.
The programme also features the words 'Guano Apes' and 'Garbage', the panic of Ramones 'Bunker Marky Ramons, Marky Ramone 's Blitzkrieg, Brutto & Lyapis, the leader of the Belarusian panel, Sergei Mihaloku, the popular civil activist and the billianist Vahik tanik Kabmaze, and Sergei Vsana Vlililiopli, and a number of other events.
This is the second year of the Kubana festival in Latvia.
Last year it failed financially and suffered huge losses, but it did not stop the organisers from re-attempting to add a taste to the name, it also included a Latvian group (on Friday evening 19: 15 on the spectacle of the All Day Long) and said that the festival was now "closer and acquired a local flash alongside Riga symbols such as its panorama and cats."
Whether this effort will be justified is to be judged too early, because the festival is only flowing but, as Delfi Izklaide observed in the first evening, at least enormous human effort has not been lured and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British treasury cycling team doubled the best Olympic record and wins in a sprinklist.
The British treasury team doubled the Olympic record on Thursday and won a bright line for men.
The first Olympic record British was replagued in the qualification but the first round of the competition was restored by young boys.
The British club met with New Zealand in the final finals, leaving them with silver medals.
In the final, the club defeated 42.440 seconds, with a 0.102 seconds victory over the New Zealand.
In the battle for the bronze, the French team was over Australia.
I have to add that the record was also corrected for women 's miscarriages, with the British team correcting the world record of 4: 13.260.
He stayed in the shadows: Gustav Zemgal, 145.
On Friday, 12 August, the year of the birth of the second Latvian President Gustav Zemgal is 145.
The country proclaimed the country, but has remained unjustly featured in the shadows of the first president of Latvia, John Chakste, and the last pre-war period of the country.
None of our statesmen have defended democracy and the rule of law as much as the Zemgals, Gustavam Zemgale 's book ten years ago writes Arnolds Auzins.
In talks with Delfi, Auzins says Zemgal is one of the few high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humour.
Others are tough, always very correct.
He did not, nowadays it might be like Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was close to the people," Auzins said.
Today 's politicians know history badly, they referred to Carly Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely know how unbearable he was.
At government meetings, the only person he has not breached was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smile in his bills, he was by nature hysterical.
"The earth gives the opposite impression with its sense of humour and democracy," Auzins said.
Professor Aivars Stranga, the Faculty of History and philosophy at the University of Latvia, agrees with Auzina 's assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and weighed statesman.
He also notes that Zemgals has shown respect for minorities, has regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time it was not the usual course of action, after the Home Presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," the historian said.
He was such a silent and weighed man who had to be used to being president for a long time.
He did not aspire for it himself, just do not hurt the glory.
He also looked at himself rather critically, because he did not know French, but felt that the President should certainly understand it.
"At the time of the Presidency, the foundations of the French language were taught," Stranga explains.
The earth did not want to get used to speak again, he did not like a very good job.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in Latvia 's history, even before he went to the office of president - he was a much-requested notary.
He also headed the famous Suvorova Street of Zemgale, 3, where the Sharkware and Scandiners 'Society was located, the Latvian state was practically in talks with the government.
He was always progressive.
It was not a great girl of Ulmlin, but he was not opposed publicly.
"In private talks, he has sometimes said that the actions of a real Ulm are not sympathetic to him," Stranga said.
Inhabited a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of malpractice or corruption.
How does the Earth remember today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he is associated with just one street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were central.
"No major turmoil occurred during his time, namely he could associate himself with such a truly stable Presidency," said Stranga.
Gustava under the rotating rotating Presidency, from 1927 to 1930, also made a visit to Sweden by the country, which, at that time, implicitly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations in northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgala was visiting the country 's visit to Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustava V 's reply visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Simply ways of helping a child to cope with anger jumps.
I often have to deal with the fact that parents consider the appearance of anger, angery, angry, to be something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly displays its anger - we do not know how to respond, Econet says psychologist Jekatrell Kesa.
The specialist encourages a little negotiation of these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that everyone periodically experiences.
Agresia - it is already a physical activity directed against another person and usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, angry - usually we know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger on our own: express, suppress, hide, keep on ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can wash the sofa in anger, stupid the cigarette (that is not the best way to disperse the anger) - go into the dustairs, get into the table and do other things that we do not normally do.
We do not take our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they find anger, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say: 'Be away', 'You are stupid', 'The mystery', 'I don 't see you', 'I am not friendly with you' - and very rarely when you say, 'I am angry on you'.
Children live in the literal sense, they are entirely here, at this point in time, they are spontaneous and truly exhibiting their feelings, and are often also held hostage by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not ban a child from showing anger, including anger, disgraceful of it, and do not worry about it, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Should the relationship be broken?
A day of long work in which everything has not gone as you would like, or simply a bad atmosphere, is so many reasons why I would like for a moment, a day or even longer to 'switch' from the whole world.
Can you look at the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Or, though, does it show that each of the partners has its own way to go?
Municipality varies from one age to another.
Janis (23) is short and concise: "In my view, if you need a pause in the relationship, you don 't be with the right person."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that may help anyone.
If you feel that a partner starts to go to nerves for every tiny detail, then surely it is the right time to look at other fields of hunting to see whether you are lacking him or, in particular, not thinking about him or not even wanting to see him any more.
So the answer is: yes, withholding a passport can save time and understand how important it is for you to have one side.
Kaspars (29) reveals its theory.
I think that the relationship should be held by one person every day because, if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I have every detail that the other does, and that is beginning to fall on nerves.
People are beginning to beat each other, especially when you are not even talking about anything more, just what you have done every day.
My personal experience leads me to think so, so I have not had a relationship for more than a couple of months either.
If you think for a moment that elsewhere or elsewhere is better, then why does this woman, with whom you are together, deserve a woman who can think that it is not good enough and there is a field of paradise behind the mountains?
Think alone is already a little betrayal.
If not, there is no.
"I have, so a little punishment for those who do not have," teic Edmunds (46).
The pound (33) has almost the opposite opinion.
It seems to me that everyone needs a moment in the matter.
You cannot watch each moment, all the time, from morning to night, each other 's love is ridiculous.
Too much!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballots.
Everything has its own time.
Of course, a friend or wife as well, but if both are able to keep a balance between family life and the rest of the world, they can live up to the edge of the grave.
That is how it is.
Martyrs (27) say as follows: 'It is difficult to say whether it is necessary or not, may or may not take a pause of it, but one thing is clear: there is nothing wrong for its initiator in the relationship to its end, something is lacking'.
If this question is raised, it must be taken into account that there will be some change in the near future, for good or bad, depending on itself.
I think that while you are still new and crazy, you need it in the mean time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend all your lives together!
"If you are not able to withstand each other 's society now and need some breathing once and for all, then what will happen when you are pensioners who comment on how the garden cats are sling or arguing about which day the garden needs to be better raced," said Kristaps (19).
All the words of Mr Barroso have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rosental first aroused the lats 'popular interest in the patenting arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvians people, which as such will remain inalienable," Roman Suta wrote about the old meter of Latvian painting Jani Rosental.
In 2016, when we discover the large exhibition of the ancient Master in the restored National Arts Museum of Latvia, it is clear that Rosental is the first love of the Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is open for visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Arts, with a wide retrospection in the newly-opened Big Exhibition, celebrates Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose 100th birthday is now on the international scene of UNESCO.
The exhibition, which covers more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the annual programme of Rosentale.
The Arts Selection is largely made up of the Latvian National Arts Museum, which strongly represents the main stages and the diversity of the classical creative activities.
In addition, the exhibits from the Museum of Akseli Gæa-Kallelas, the Museum of Writing and Museum, the Liepaja Museum, the Museum of Tukuma and a number of private collections in Latvia and Finland are used.

Met Leblanks looks forward to returning to TopGear this year with impatience.
Mets Leblanks, head of TopGear, said he was looking forward to a return to the second season, but said he did not know who expected him in the future.
Nothing is officially happening yet.
"If so, it will be announced by the BBC," Leblank told reporters in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas in the floor" arose in July when Leblanca 's champion Kriss Evanss said he would go out of the programme.
After leaving Evanss admitted that Leblank and Gas on the floor "are" designed for each other. "
Evan 's former "Friends" (Draugi) star is described as a "real and good man," thus dispelling rumours that the friendship of both is upset during filming.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most this year, he replied that travelling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC television channel reported that it does not plan to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

His interpretation of the US model business has won a perverse photovoltaic glanci and the intolerability of the movie.
Basically, a very provocative, sophisticated and trivial balloquic work in which the boundaries between the European art house film and the area of the Hollywood God product are difficult to draw.
The film, with Vigo Mortensenu, highlights whether parents 'conceptual life models (ecology, vegetarianism, alternative and dissociation from the spirit and values of society) are blessing or destructive to their children.
After the death of his wife, the father of six children is confronted with questions about the regularity of choices and the true values.
A moving, life-wise film by Met Ross has won the Cannes Film Award this year.
Of course, the shark is doing this alone as an attack on the vicious lies - in the Zos, it was a swimming, in this case a brave server, reconstituted by Bleika Laivley.
The job has required her great heroism.
This solonumour of survival can be compared to the 127 hours of the demonstration by Jesus Franco actiermeistarship and the Ray Réoldsa Games in the film Aprakt live.
The father of the main role, Mila Kunisa, is probably also guilty, whose misgivings from the exemplary motherhood of the looming and teenage love of family values seem to be only a rather desperate fantasy of the desperate Holysmuda Sscript.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic state fighters have shattered about 2,000 civilians who are used as human shields after fleeing from Manbij, Syria province, the U.S. pro-Arab alliance and observers said Friday.
"We have not shot to them because they have taken civilians with them when they fleeing Jerrabus," a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij military council said in a statement.
After two months of fighting, Kurdish pro-Kurdish Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish Arab alliance in northern Syria, said Friday that Manbij was released from jihadists.
Islamic State Manbiu was taken in 2014.
QSD had already evicted most Islamic State militants from Manbij last week, but some were resistant and strenuous.
On Friday, however, they left the town to take prisoners with them.
The Islamist goes to Jerusalem, which is at the border with Turkey.
Around 2,000 people were kidnapped in London by Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).
The SOHR reported that Islamist kidnapped the vehicles of the city 's inhabitants, forced people to disembark and then pushed them to Jerrabus.
The Islamic State fighters have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamist kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the area of Deir ez Zora province in eastern Syria.
Later, the Islamist liberated about 270 of the prisoners.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled from Manbij is unknown.
A spokesman from the Kurdish Menbij military council reported that QSD was able to save 2,500 people held hostage by Islamist militants in Manbij.
According to the Observatory, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the Cup.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
The Kolegova renounces his candidacy for the Revenue Service 's headquarters.
Inga Kolegova, head of state environment service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), LETA was informed by the Finance Ministry.
The Kolegova says that her candidacy talks have fuelled controversy among the governing coalition parties.
The real reasons for the discussion seem to relate to the visible but more frequent invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the appraisal of my professional capacity.
"This is not acceptable to me either," he said.
In the case of her candidacy being approved by the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would prevent her from working and implementing the necessary changes to the SRS, with the support of the whole government.
Without this, it would not be possible to work fully, Kolegova said.
"I have repeatedly said publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment the whole process of my candidacy is over-politicised," the official said.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, this is an experience that I value as a benefit," Kolegova wrote in his application to Reiznienie-Ozolai.
Unity said on Wednesday that the meeting with Kolegova revealed "significant discrepancies" between the candidate 's explanations and the information available in the public registers on the costs of the Pallogs dividend, as the decisions of the public Pallogs meeting are not to distribute the profits.
At the moment, the Revenue Service is headed by Deputy Director General Dace Peleka.
The police are involved in rescuing two young children left unsupervised by police forces, the state police in the Latgale region said.
The report on unsupervised wheeled babies was received on Friday around 7 p.m.
They were in the Liges near the former store building.
Both small girls were immediately put in the hands of the medical community for help.
A documentary and mobile phone Finnish was also left in the wheelers.
In a short time of half an hour, the law guards found out the whereabouts and doses of children 's parents.
During their visit to the home of a civilian man, police officers found that the woman was sleeping because of the high alcohol inflammatory.
According to preliminary information, in the evening of the previous day, a woman born in 1992 went to a friend where alcohol was consumed.
As soon as she goes home following a joint sitting, the woman has decided to leave the child in the shop under unexplained conditions.
The police immediately informed the barring court about the events, which will also decide on the fate of children.
Riga has implemented all the GCC 's recommendations in relation to the Russian island project.
The Riga freeport authority has implemented all of the overall five recommendations of the State Control (NC) regarding the development of the project infrastructure in the island of Yuku for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, as reported by Diena.lv.
The approval of the project is scheduled for the next meeting of the Riga Free Port Board.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the VC 's discretion in preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, Riga Free Port Administration also managed the legal and operational audit conclusions of the international auditor Deloitte Riga 's Free Port Administration and issued recommendations for improving project management in the next phase of the project.
The information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent today to the EQF.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Authority does not agree with the opinion of the KICs on the feasibility of implementing the Russian-island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider, the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction work planned within the framework of the project has been fully completed within the agreed deadlines and planned levels.
"In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the CGC and also the environment that the main objective of the free port is the successful implementation of the project, we have fully implemented all the GCC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues," said Sanita Kaire, head of the Russian-Island project.
The long-term action plan for monitoring the achievement of the project was supplemented by the major planned actions of the parties concerned and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definition and timescales of meetings and regular reviews, the instruments for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definition of the major milestones.
The approved Action Plan for reaching the project 's objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the CGC, has been supplemented by follow-up actions, thus reinforcing the control of the other stakeholders in the project 's implementation by the Riga Free Port.
In order to streamline project management and minimise potential risks, a project management plan has been redeveloped, defining the project 's management areas and identifying the documents developed to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
The project 's capacity building is a project management structure that reflects the planned structure, qualifications and functions of the project 's management team.
In order to improve the communication of Riga free administration to the stakeholders of the project, a project stakeholder communications plan has been developed which, in addition to the parties identified in the project 's Action Plan, defines the stakeholders involved in the successful completion of the project, the principles, ways and periodicity of information exchange.
Conversely, in order to improve the control of the use of funds, it will be necessary in future to justify in more detail the need for the conclusion or the launch of a service contract and the rule of law.
As part of the project, port infrastructure in line with world standards has been constructed on the island of Russians, with four new deep-sea access, rail access and engineering communications.
The construction co-financed by the Cohesion Fund has been completed and put into service by the end of last year, resulting in a financial saving of €10.6 million.
In Slovakia, the threat increases security at airports.
Slovakia strengthened security measures at several airports on Friday after receiving unspecific threats, the interior ministry said.
"In view of the threat, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," a spokesman for the Slovak Ministry of the Interior told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
On September 16, the Slovak capital will hold an informal summit between the European Union and all the bloc countries except the UK.
The UK Brexit referendum will be discussed and discussed the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the "Berlin Wall."
According to a new study, the number of fatalities on the communist axis may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims are still not dispelled.
According to data released on Wednesday by Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall Museum, between 1945 and 1989, 1 841 people were murdered by the Communist authorities on the border with western allies and the then Western Wall, trying to escape their controlled territory.
Museum for border deaths has been studying for years and adjusting the number of victims once and for all.
This year an additional 11 fatalities have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned when the family tried to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet troops 'defects.
"The final damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," adds the director of the museum, Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in trying to escape a Communist state are maintained and not disappear," he said in a statement released by Hillary Holderman.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure 1841 is incredible," John Sttant, an expert in the history of East Germany at the University of Berlin Free, told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
He, together with other researchers from the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing alleged deaths at the border and has so far succeeded in approving only 260 cases.
Earlier, the researchers estimated that only 138 people were murdered by the communists of the Berlin Wall.
In the view of those who have died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or get to the West through the neighbouring countries, the number of victims could be around a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be the different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie 's museum also lists all cases of suicide by the border guards of East Germany, whether directly related to their service.
Museum also depicts non-direct deaths.
"If the ancestors aged between 70 and 80 died from hearts after the fall in border control," he said, it should be the consequence of this "murderous border."
However, Schtate is convinced that a distinction needs to be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of the treatment they have experienced, and those who have died as a result of long waiting times on the bus at the border.
Regardless of this, the census of victims is not easy, as the Communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and the researchers have to issue documents in various scattered archives, the Sttant said.
However, the group has recently passed new documents, and it could therefore present a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone on Rio, with the accreditation of the trainer; that is a surprise itself.
In recent days, Kaspars Pone of the Rio Olympic Games have been honoured by the Latvian Federation of Peleton (LPF) President Kaspars Pone RioJaneiro with the accreditation of his trainer, but I feel surprised about this.
On Wednesday, a large-scale aciojatism arose following statements by Olympic swimming coach Alaon Ribakova, Germans Jakubovska, who said he had decided to go to the Pone at the last minute, while the trainer had to stay at home.
Originally approved swimmers Alona Ribakov and Uvis Kalnins, coaches Jakubolev and Deivs Collins, as well as President Pone of the Federation, were among those on the list.
Aldon Vrublevskis said that Germans would and would be looking for tickets before the start of the competition.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he did not," Pone said, stating that it did not affect Ribakov 's result.
At the request of the federation, Uwaja 's coach assumed to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, strongly criticised the activities of the LOK, which led to the blame for the organisation that oversees the Olympic Games.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to carry one of them.
"I do n 't know why the Fellow Federation did n 't have the place," Pone said, recalling that the federations and their presidents were unpaid.
Pone also criticised Jakubovsky himself, saying that before the London Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he referred the complaint to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
One could not tell why he was in the Olympic Games with a trainer 's accreditation, which was probably due to Jakubovsky.
"I was filed as president of the Federation (" team leader ") but received accreditation for unknown reasons and now nowhere in the dark."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditation available changed.
Until the last moment, I think that Germans will be, because I did not have any other information.
According to information at LETA 's disposal, she had been talking with her eyes to the Poni a couple of days before the start of the Ribakova, and afterwards had been sailing with tears in the eyes, but the president himself said that it had been a daily conversation with the desire to be athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five sports types that are part of the Olympic Agenda and four of them are also trained for children in Latvia.
The president said that issues of drowning are also very important in Latvia, and he also spoke about such programmes, while he was in Rio for almost two weeks.
He praised the federation 's work and said that Latvia could be in the run-up to the World Cup in 2018.
The trauma in Rio de Janeiro is not my leave, I worked here, spent my time and tried to implement four-year programmes.
600 000 salmon babies will be thrown into the gazette.
During Latvia 's recovery programme this week in Daugava, a young salmon and baby teenagers are being picked up this week in Daugava, and more than 600 000 babies and teenagers from the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles are due to be planted this year.
A total of 6.300,000 juveniles and guns of different species are allowed into the Daugava Basin waters each year, LETA was told that the dispersal of fish will continue in the coming months.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, poppies and night-leguns will be released, in June, wet, in July, single summer salmon, in August and September, thandarts and wimbs.
Māris Kunickis, Director of Latvian Production, said that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of sustainable development in Latvia 's energo concert.
"The conservation and reproduction activities of fishery resources all focus on environmentally-friendly activities, in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both through the farming and release of juveniles in the Daugava Basin and through other activities," he said.
This year, more than 600 000 minors will be admitted to the Daugava floor.
For the second year, juveniles have been tagged with their fins cut before being introduced.
Today there are 25,000 young salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams on the stretch.
An annual entry of juveniles and cats into the water bodies of Daugava and its basin, on the basis of scientific evidence, shall be carried out.
The multiplication of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies is carried out by Bior, in accordance with the law, on the basis of an assessment of the damage to fish resources caused by economic activities in Latvia, and of what compensation measures should be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, the National Environment Service, on the basis of that expertise, decides on the amount and nature of the compensation.
The annual compensation amount for Latvia for fish stocks is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvijas energo, in cooperation with the Union We Fish, has placed 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugava at Kaibala and Ikšķiles for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the Society in promoting the natural spawning of fish is a complementary initiative supported by Latvia within the framework of the recovery programme for fish resources.
The deployment of fertile spawning nests in watercords is an important step in promoting the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The Sanst Hotel festival is a rural carpet, forest, circus.

There is the theatre and the newspaper circus, performances and instalments with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the roof of concert medicine.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile in the face and ease was just a couple of minutes.
"Please do not look for the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not travel to one particular event or an artist, because the real Sans can only catch the taste for all three days," the festival 's initiator and manager, Operbariton Siliins, said.
The festival is opened at 17: 00 on Friday and the first concert is at 19: 00.
Of course, there will be all the information software on the ground.
We recommend Saturday to those who have to choose one day because it is the most saturated, from 9 a.m. in the morning to the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv," said Richard Silinš.
There are, for example, vijolist Eva Bindere, Celliste Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, Cliftist Grell Kuzma, Tromsha Janis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zarins, Quartet and RIX and even Estonian Air Book Grete Grote, who, together with Latvian musicians Eric Egars, Markinsons, Zycartsiaki-Zir and Straya Stir 's Stir 's Stir 's Strair 's Strair 's Stiriririr, who are building onrairyir 's artirairir 's artiir.
New works have been made for the festival specifically.
The children of Kukainis, who are comprised in the motives of Olyja Kozlovska and Jekabs Nordman, will be accompanied by entomologist (insect research) Ugis Peran, along with the Kafka Street Street, Musicians and Actors.
Oscars Herliins has hoped for the first Strait of the Quartet, while Anna Ķirse, the Coca opera, the performance of which heroes in the director of Andra Kalnozola, with video projections of Catherine Neiburgas and Andra Eugsh scenography, will be trees in three shadows in a three-hectare square.
From the voices of the Laimas Ledians, Dinar Rudane and Zigmar Graša, they will end up in a romantic relationship, as in the study by the Swedish science scientist Carla Linneja on the Coca Town (1729).
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, one of the largest hopes of the Latvian delegation in Rio de Janeiro today.
Ikauniece-Admidina will open the competition at 1.35 p.m. and start at 16.50 p.m.
On Saturday, the bullet will start pushing until 4.05 p.m. at 2.35 p.m. on Saturday.
The seven-metre race will be closed on Saturday.
Prior to the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidina, who won the bronze at the World Cup last year, was mentioned as a medallist of the Olympic Games.
In May, the Latvian champion installed a new state record (6622 points) and ranked second in the seven prestigious championships in the Austrian city of Gecisz.
Ikauniece-Admidina also took part in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when she won the ninth place with the record of Latvia.
In the past one and a half years, the athletes have changed the record four times.
Latvia 's Judo Cup spokesman Arthen Nizikiforenko, who is in the rank of over 100 kilograms, is also expected to play Azerbaijan 's champion Usagi Kukauri in the first round.
For Jesus, this will be the first ever Olympic Games.
As reported, Latvia 's Judo Cup spokesman Jevgenijs Borodavko suffered losses in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms on Thursday.
He climbed the Japanese lady, Mr Rjunoski, who then obtained the bronze.
In 2000 Vsevolods Zolonium gave Latvia the Olympic bronze goaltender, while in the next four Olympic Games Latvian Janedians together won only one victory, which was done directly by Borodavko in London.
Dainis Upelnieks will start the competition at 16: 30 CET, but the selection will be completed on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic Tour Label just on the day the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he told LETA that it had been quite safe to travel since April.
The sport came at the Olympic Games as one of Latvia 's first sportsmen and sportswomen trying to make the best use of training opportunities in the shooting of the matches.

Reids argues that, if Clinton is elected to the office of president, he will appoint Garlands as a judge to the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reids, believes that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merica Garlandu as the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked the approval of Garlanda since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate leader Michel Makonnel said the next president would choose who would replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonina Skaliu.
On Thursday, at his conference, Reids said he was confident that Clinton would opt for Garland.
The Reida representative later said that he had not spoken personally on the subject with Clinton and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garlande and said Clinton 's team would not want to 'rob the boat' with a different choice.
Garlands is the Chief Referee of the US District Appeals Court.
Reids said that the Russians, who are blocking the nomination of Garlanda, are "elected" and are acting in the interests of Donald Trump, the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.
He also said Trump was not fit for president.
The treatment announces the cailphoto calendar for women and men.
The magazine 's Treaty will work with David Belmayors to set up the 2017 calendar "Pirrel" in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Music calendar, it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not naked glords.
Earlier this year, the president of the magazine Treaty Strauve said that his erotic art magazine was different from the oldest Playboy, because "Playboy is a magazine of men."
The magazine is female.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.
In a press release about the production of the calendar, this wrote: "We must return to the scenes of unmasked and classic naked pictures where the female body is not confused but inspired both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is an excellent work of art.
Models can send their photo electronically or personally to the caterers in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video survey

A French court rejects a request to dismantle shops in the "Jungle" refugee camp.
A French court rejected a request by the authorities in Calais to dismantle tens of self-constructed shops and restaurants in the camp of Jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At a hearing in Calais this week, authorities said that the country should dismantle 72 self-constructed shops, where people sell different goods in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euros in self-constituted restaurants.
In Calais, the Prefect Office said that these self-constituted companies should be demolished because they create a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, and they pose fire and sanitary risks.
Human group representatives told the court that these small businesses were essential because food provided by governments and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp in which the number of residents continues to rise.
They also pointed out that self-constructed shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those most in need.
The Court of Lille ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have set up 72 self-established shops, but it understands the prefect 's concerns in Calais.
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply provide food for people who live in "extremely unusual conditions."
He pointed out that these sites are peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids," which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French, and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors without the help of adults.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the child cafe.
According to a letter addressed to Guardian, the winding-up of cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities and L 'Auberge des Migrants said that the number of residents of the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000, the highest ever since the sharp influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain gets silver rugby-7 in a row when the Fiji national unit fights the gold in a macist struggle.
The spectacular performance of the British team ended on Thursday when the Deodoro stadium defeated them 43: 7 in an exciting final.
Fiji demonstrated the Maistarclash in the management of the bomb, the ball was playing with the leg, the aid game and the brutal game, fighting gold, the first Olympic medal in its history.
A silver medal was the third medal of Britain 's first Olympic rugby, Argentina and South Africa.
Basketball: Box defeated in the first half of the consecutive 7-5 day.
But, in any case, Fiji is in its best shape to win the 15 men 's team as well.
But some comfort for Britain might be the fact that at least one British had a golden medal; it is Fiji 's head coach Ben Rutan, a former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Rayst 's leadership, they lost all the playing in a regbia-7 series in Adelaid.
This time they lost only one game.
The link is painful, but growth is astonishing.
Fiji spectacularly started a match, replicating British forces for joy.
Captain Tomam Michel and his comrades were in contact with several driving buses and the World Cup championships 5: 0, when Osea Kolinisau was in first place.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the predominance by practising the beneath of the right-wing.
The result was 12: 0 and the British team had not even really touched the ball.
Michel 's great strength did not allow Leoni Nakarava to reach three points, but it only had a slight impact on Fiji 's result.
Jasa Veremalua was on the right corner in the seventh minute of the game, strengthening the predominance of Britain to 17: 0.
After the match, Nakarava further increased the predominance and had stayed for more than a minute until the end of the first half.
Mr Ravouvou avoided some unfortunate methods of British force and crossed the line with points.
The bottom up was 29: 0.
Fiji seemed to have been born to play a regbia-7 game, while the British were still learning.
In fact, that is also true.
The club made profound changes in lunchtime, breaking Fiji 's basketball line... with four minutes, which was good after the first half of the time, until Joshua Tuisova, the fantastic team 's match, scored a few points for Fiji 's team.
Denam Northam scored 36: 7 points in a left-left-left-left-leaning match, while the South Sea salvage fans were on the floor, winning flags and dancing on the roofs.
One cannot fail to admire the spectacular attitude of Fiji.
Mata Viliame made Fiji 's victory ever more sweetened, with another stop at the end of the game.
Fiji could begin to celebrate when it came to the end of the game, while the British were able to sit down in the room after defeat.
Fiji scored 20: 5 in the first half of the day, while the British were overshadowed by South Africa, where the two teams were on the floor and the South fricians lost only a few points in a very fierce struggle.
During the first half of the season, Kail Brauns put forward Box 's team, while Den Northon crossed the line with bright matches and took the ball between the rooms in the second half.
Marxus Vatanensona, who is the Anthray brother of England 's regbia-15 team, has won the team 's victory at the end of the game and has won another silver medal.
The Trenera 's fight against cancer has inspired Helena Gloveri and Heteri Staningu to win the air competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it is already saying a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, the gold of Helena Gloveres and Heteres Staningas played a special role in the trawl of Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they have only both athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by the minds of Robin Wilders, who inspired them up to the second Olympic golden medal to get a pair for women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport to have made such a success.
They undoubtedly dominated because, for the 39th time, they won an unrivalled, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes drow down the water surface with the bed 's eleganci do not fully reflect this triumph.
Beyond every golden medal, there is a whole team working hard to ensure that athletes continually improve their performance and the largest contribution to their success was made by a trainer who, just 30 months ago, did not know whether I would survive the day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it did.
I had the wind of a uranium crowd, which is one of those that can and did operate.
If not, it would spread over the whole body.
And the situation would get out of hand.
It changes your vision a little.
Counterfeiting cancer was detected in December 2013.
This trio succeeded in opening the recovery procedure at the beginning of the inter-season 2014 in Vilnius and reducing the interruption to a minimum, if I may say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in hospital and I went a distance of 6, 10 and even 15 metres, although the doctor said that some steps would be enough.
All this started.
Aircraft in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Wilders, who was very worried throughout the morning and spoke more than usual in the wake of the turmoil.
Standing, who served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: 'This was a week of emotionally heavy gaze, but it means a great deal to me'.
This only confirms how much this means to us and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years with Helena and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he is the best trainer in the world.
I cannot imagine better trainers or better coaches.
Helena Glover and Hetere Staninga have not lost any race in five years.
A couple is reaching such a huge speed as the rivals cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Staning and Gloves were overweight.
We felt every moment.
He said, "Keeping the rhythm, retains the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We managed to get a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of overthrowing record records, but simply rowing and winning the races well, and that is what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month there will be Strab Bashala 's wedding foot in Glover and television.
For the time being, she simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
That would have been too much pressure.
I needed about six months in London to realise that I am a Olympic champion.
This was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said: 'The puzzle is fantastic'.

The Kolegova as the VID 's head will be pushed to the last.
According to him, Prime Minister Mars Kucinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) are already "fundamentally important" to approve Kolegova as the prime minister of the Revenue Service.
Rajevskis estimates that the approval of both Kucinskis and Reiznieniecei-Ozolai in this government is the "first big decision" that can affect their future as politicians.
If the position of the Revenue Service 's candidate is now to be changed, this will have a negative impact on their implication in the public administration.
The issue of the transfer of VVD chief Kolegova as Director General of the Revenue Service has been placed on the agenda for next week 's meeting, according to the government 's agenda.
Colegova was nominated by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola as the head of the Revenue Service after Inara Petersone resigned and when the competition for the Revenue Service 's Director-General ended without result.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday 11 August, Dace Peleka, the Revenue Service 's assistant, confirmed that if she were offered to be a leader, she would be able to agree.
The finance minister said later that no other candidates for the Revenue Service 's head had been considered.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the Saeima National Alliance, also said that the NA is still supporting Kolegova under the chairmanship of the Revenue Service.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is being jeopardised by the inability to form a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal had failed to take sufficient measures to bring their deficits down to the 3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) requested by the Euro Zone.
According to estimates, despite the austerity measures taken, Portugal 's budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5. 1% in Spain.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, but rather to set fiscal targets in the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not, however, impose sanctions on the two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative attitude.
Critics point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing, from the outset, uniform rules and then unable to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jenss Veidmanns, has said that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that the European Union 's rules are recommendations and not binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission pledges in the coming months to examine the progress made by both countries, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if conditions so require.
The initial forecasts suggest that Portugal could achieve its target in time and that already this year its deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the country 's government must implement savings of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year 's budget, with an additional focus on monitoring the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year 's budget deficit should be reduced to 4. 6%, next year to 3. 1% and 2018 to 2. 2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0. 5% of GDP each year in the next two years.
The fact that, for eight months now, the Spanish political parties have failed to reach agreement on the formation of a government makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to be able to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the political picture of the third elections in the country would not be significantly altered either.
The most populous party is still the current People 's Party led by Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, which would again win less than 33% of the votes.
Only the socialists have contributed to their popularity, while the anti-austerity party Podemos, or 'Together we can', and Ciudadanos, or Citizens, have slightly decreased their popularity.
The People 's Party wants socialist and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission the draft 2017 budget before mid-October for approval.
According to the spokesperson of the People 's Party 's Parliamentary Party, Rafael Hernando, if the government is not set up and parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing stock of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of smooth beds in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After a fifth year of beaches, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste discovered is increasing year on year, and the majority of bathing sites are blamed for this.
The most polluted bathing sites are in Riga.
Galicia City Council explains that there is a daily patchwork of bathing sites, but it is very difficult to combat dirty visitors.
In addition, landfill waste can be washed in water during rainfall, thus greatly damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain sites in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This statement has been disseminated this week by the volunteers of the 'My Sea' campaign.
In the midst of the fifth year 's wedding road along the Gulf of Riga, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year, we have seen a critical assessment of this.
"We see that this will be a year in which the number of waste on the beach may even exceed 200 units per 100 metres," said Janis Ulme, spokesman for the expedition.
Latvian Radio called, he was on the beach of Immedia, where a voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, between the various municipal waste and the rest of the pepperics, activists have had to collect even the fluorescent lamps left in the sand of the sea.
It is the citizens who are responsible for the pollution of the participants and the organiser Ulme teic.
"The main source is the beachers themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, from bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the depletion phase, it is no longer possible to identify them and to smoke, bottles, corks," Ulme says.
The cleanest beaches include bathing sites in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgric, on average, almost 800 waste units have been collected per 100 metres, which is critical.
The campaign organisers also explain that you are smoked almost every step and that you do not have any warning or ban signs everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites together - Daugavans, Vacarbubles and Old Origin - are unfortunately large and far above the target, which Latvia is heading for, to reduce its waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender said.
The swimming of bathing sites in Riga takes place every day, even twice in the summer 's hot days, the council 's spokesman Uģis Vidauskis said.
However, the struggle with dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who grow, consume alcohol, smoke and do everything they can 't, even special signs do n 't work," Vidauskis said.
That is why Vidauskis is calling for sites to be reported to the police as well.
You can call a police force, safely point out these abuses and thus fight everyone.
It may be possible to issue some new warnings but, as I said, it is unlikely that this will change the situation radically.
"As everyone together simply has to speak out and be intolerant of such offenders," he said.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that in all 56 bathing sites water quality has always been good and there are no bathing restrictions.
"Once again, we will take the analysis at the end of August," said Normunds Kadiķis, the senior inspector for environmental health.
Waste left on land may be washed in water during heavy rainfall.
This may in turn affect its quality, according to an environmental expert.
Rotation in the Russian elite continues - in Putin 's administration the change of head.
He was leaving office?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov had chosen to leave the post himself and would continue to be the special representative of the president for nature, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin gave Ivanov a welcome to the television cameras: 'Dear Sergej Borisovič, we have been working together with you for many years and we are doing it well'.
I am pleased with the way in which you carry out your duties.
I am well aware of our agreement not to use you in this chairmanship of the presidential administration for more than four years.
I am therefore conscious of your desire to change the scope of action.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role as well.
It is pointed out, however, that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that the Duma elections are to be held in Russia next month, rumours have arisen that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible substitute for Putin as president, so the claim that he himself wanted to hold the office of president on nature protection and transport has raised doubts.
As shown by the Archive of Lsms, Ivanov is the Colonel of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his longer-term speculators in 1975, when he became familiar with Putin.
As he became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, following Putin 's arrival in power, Ivanova 's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, including the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergei Ivanov became Russia 's defense minister and in 2005 he became Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkova and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the office of head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration Vaino will also be in place.
Vaino comes from the family Soviet elite.
Vaino himself has been recommended as head of the administration of the President.
We have long known with Antonu Eduardovich.
They were all the time we worked in the government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we have been communicating practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, after all his professional and personal qualities, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The culmination comes from a family belonging to the Soviet elite.
His grandfather Karls held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including his first secretary ten years until 1988.
In the late 1980s Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators with reference to the book "Estonia 's self-determination and independence."
However, he has been denied and has lost his post in the near future.
Shortly afterwards, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow 's Institute for International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
As reported, Russia has been shaken by the suspension of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including replacements of governors and federal representatives in several regions.
According to polylogists, President Vladimir Putin is reshuffling the ruling elite before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing number of members of the power bodies in leading positions.
The Judo Cup, Nizikiforenko, is also losing the first Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the struggle, and the Latvian Judo Cup has closed its participation in the Olympic Games by finalising in 17th place.
Trenders Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that New York 's expectations had been very little, and that was already clear before the competition.
He also said that the judo battlew had a shoulder trauma.
Significantly, in order to get the Olympic road mark, Nizikiforenko had to be placed in a different weight category to that of weight - that is, weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani battlew was 25 kilograms heavier.
As reported, Jevgeny Borodavko held a two-and-a-half minute battle against Rjunosuki until his opponent won a clean victory.
As a result, Latvia has closed the Jupo competition in Rio.
The apples are disappearing in Rio sand.
The jihadist Jevgenijs Borodavko was inaugurated Thursday.
Yes, he had a more contiguous opponent in return, but the ambitious ones can come as a surprise at times.
He did not.
Arl Nikiforenko 's task was even more complex, because the experience of smaller and opponent will also be respected.
The result was similar, even though he held almost one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvian Janjadians are the most lacking in ambition.
Gunar Ķirsons and his financial staple Vladimir socievianowov have left Latvia after leaving his country, as Golden Score has gone down the curve.
The heirs of Kazakh Judistus and of Vsevoldam Zilony do not see them.
But if we do not grow, there will be no.
And it is a prerogative of the Federation.
As a result, the pledge made by the president of the Latvian Federation of Judo, Rio, to win the medals, was echoed by another gallery, Rita panorama.
The flight is a long way from reality.
We looked forward to the Samoilovs / Smedins of the beache voleyball match, Evandru / Pedru Solbergs, in the evening with impatience and concern.
Intrigas as in the death group, the losers have lost their games.
Latvia 's dozen had a small derogation - it was also possible to lose, but not more than four points in two.
The tension was brought up by the prolonged previous game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling was over the top of the cold corner for the whole game.
The spectacular wind caused further complications for the players.
It seemed at the beginning that it could be our ally, which is more comprehensive.
But it did not.
It was quite easy to play the duds of Latvia here.
They are going to Samoilova and waiting for him to burst.
Canada was buried, Cuba was buried at the end of the first and the beginning of the third, because the load was no joke.
The man was able to angle at the time, because there was little work, but when it was, it did it honestly.
Samoilovs won two-sixths in the first place with 16: 15, but also lost to 16 points.
But one could also lose 0: 2 because the second sixth deficit was -4, but thanks also to the win.
The third one had already dragged the ECR.
There was a chain of unconvincingly admitted serve, the second game often fly too close to the network and Samoilovam was left with very little scope for a fruitful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov in the square against the Cuban people, then this time he was more successful and it would be unprofessional only to remove the loss to his own people.
The Kremlin was wrong, too, and it was his symbolic day that the last bomb block was shot at him.
The team is losing.
There was also a certain lack of success this time: in the third quarter, two Evandru attacks almost flown out of the cort, but the bomb hit the line.
Two lashes were along the line.
The controversial episodes of the video also decided in favour of opponents.
If, in the first two games, Evandru battled with the Serbs, they were very productive towards us.
All of this was summed up in the loss on the tabloid.
The causes of the failure must now be analysed calmly.
Maybe it was like a lot to live next to a stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours.
Maybe a bit of self-confidence was given by a semi-finals series.
Perhaps it was not necessary to play in Klāgenfurt, but to come here more quickly and to acclimatise better.
Perhaps it was a mistake to find the top of the sporting form.
So far, more questions than answers.
Our bishops are at a standstill.
The dream of medals is over.
What 's next?
Some of the World Cup tournament 's tournament and the Masters of Jurmala are still left.
She has never been friends and will not be friends in the life of Samoilovs because there are too different personalities.
But it is not needed either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise, because fault will be sought not only by itself but also by the partner.
It is not difficult to choose, but it will be much more difficult to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
The two brothers are playing a bishop, but Janis and Tomas have already tried and herself, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to get into the top of the world.
One may try to return to Haraldo Regime, Alexander Solove, Edgar Tous, to Martylman, but it will not be better than this option, which has not once demonstrated itself at the stages of the World Cup.
They were not maimed by the sandwich.
And all.
Of course, we must also take into account the fact that the beaching vole is becoming more popular, when young couples are moving, and only the rare growth is less than two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success, but it is an important argument in the struggle for victory.
Nowadays there is no longer.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the gamblers and to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis do not remain in the Olympic village.
Also, part of the beache voleylists have found a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, the very modest overnight hosts of journalists were being pushed for very exaggerated prices.
That is why the choice also fell to the car rental of apparatus.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk justifies it.
Along with Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Owich 's rental apparatus on the CoPack and Ipanem border.
Declared 200 metres away, a bishop of half an hour on the march.
Rajon is safe enough, because the favelas patground, but vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir is not something that some immediately think about, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
I think another dream of a medals was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre barracks and highs Laura Ikauniece-Admidina, there was lagged from their personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, Porgijs and Gaba are in Liepaja.
In 1973, the Latvian National Operation, Porgijs and singer were first to take part.
Since then, the internationally renowned team has not been re-appointed.
That is why the organisers of the Arts Festival in Casul and the Liepaja Arts Forum have decided, in close cooperation, to give the listeners the opportunity to enjoy the position of George Gešvina.
"We are very pleased that, after a 10-year break, when Liepaja was last able to receive a study of opera, this great version of the" Porgijs "and" Opera "opera concert is to be seen by us in the new, newly-opened concert hall," says Baiba Bože, the head of the Big Engineering Car.
Opera "Porgijs and Gaba" is a splendid musical tale about love, its volatility, passivity, as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily joys.
It reflects afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this operation that this exclusion of tolerance makes it so lively.
"And yes, this love is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and really deep in some way," said Viesturs Caires, director.
What I like most is listening to or relegating to this operation, there are always such stops: the famous lielody, the famous motives, but the switchover from one nature to another, outlining one person or another person, or the corps or or orchestras.
"It 's the most exciting construction, it 's a musical manager and dirt Andris Poga of the" Porgijs "and" leisure "concert.
Visitors to the operation agree that this is a major event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear the famous Guernšvina operation in the world.
It is encouraging that Liepaja can feel the elite of the world.
"Enforcement of a professional," Edgars Lama said.
The concert was particularly marked by the fact that, for the first time in the new open concert hall, the Big Engineering was playing in orchestra in the bedre and for the first time an opera-concert behaviour took place.
A land near the Art Museum renovated buildings could be named after Jaan Rosentalla.
Riga Vice-President Andris Ameriks said at the opening of an exhibition in Rosental 's jubileyei that the museum 's own address could in future not be that of the Valdemar Street 10a, but that of Jaina Rozenthal Square 1.
Muzei 's Director, Marar LSace, said that re-registration of the address would create a great bureaucratic burden, but generally speaking, this idea was welcomed and therefore agreed with the local government 's suggestion.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, setting up the Burcarda Dzein Monument, Janim Rosental, who stands at the museum.
The then museum director, Vilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little bit crushed by the conscience - but the Vilhelm Purvitis, where we will put his name to.
"But if you promise to think, Mr Americas," he said.
The National Arts Museum building, after a major reconstruction and modernisation, officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week will finally launch the reconstruction of the VEF Castle of Culture.
About €11 million will be restored by Wales.
A number of Castle rooms, including two viewers, are planned to be renovated as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
Riga City Council plans to mobilise EUR six million in EU funds for the project, but Riga City Council 's Director Oleg Burovs says that there is still no complete clarity about the project as European funds.
"Despite the political will to undertake the renovation of the VEF Culture pilij by means of the European Structural Funds, we are waiting for a decision for months, real action from the officials of the Finance Ministry, it will be given its money or not," said Burovs.
In December last year, we were told that everything was dependent on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you decide yourself that Brussels does not take a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussion emerging again, so let us see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed in time," Burov said.
As reported, in March 2015, VEF Castle Culture Castle was collectively hosted a relay concert ahead of the immediate renovation of the building.
Although one year later, renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively under unsuitable conditions.
The Rigas City Council 's strategy for the VEF Culture Castle regeneration is divided into seemingly independent building works, where each will ensure different gravest functions.
Firstly, increasing the accessibility of the VEF Cultural Castle and renovating the surrounding area.
It provides for the adjustment of the surrounding area and engineering, as well as for the renovation of the faculties of the building.
Second, the improvement of the offer of Castle Culture services by the VEF.
It plans to improve interior, wall and ceiling renovation, stage and sound recordings, as well as to put in place internal engineering communications in the building.
Third: improving collective working conditions for creative amateur, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of the League, the legendary rock group can be consulted at an exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover various "Live" items, photographs arranged on the time line to reflect the group 's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group 's expiry is announced.
It will also showcase participants 'watchdogs, music instruments, awards and concerts, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the public, which reflected Līvi 's creative activity.
The exhibition will be supplemented by the assets of Liepaja Museum.
The exhibition 's visual presentation is made in cooperation with fashion artist and painting giant Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians, who have been associated with the League and their relatives, have also responded to the call and shared with each other the subjects and memories.
The Liverpool started in 1972, when a vocal ansatist, led by Juris Pavitol, is being set up in the Liepaja House of Culture.
Ansamblis has participated in the Liepaja Pipeline festival in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic 's eyes.
In 1966, Juris Pavitol met with Eric Cologne and Metalurgs Culture Castle set up a group calling for Ingrid man, Andri Krumins and Janana Grodums to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been in my hands only once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to demonstrate that Latvian rosé music is able to live and live has remained unchanged.
"What was not lacking - Jynitis, mataines and Bardaini, these boys were very different from the generally accepted glass-yardstick," the music watchdog Klasver said.
Excellent musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Krieins, Modris Shtherns, Valdis Sttarks, Laimis Rajrijs, Susbarr, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brush, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others have been working in the group.
Access to the exhibition shall be free of charge.
The exhibition can be seen from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, Liepaja will host the 40-year-old LĪVIfest 2 celebrations at Liepaja St garden.
Bulgaria is experiencing inflation for the first time in 8 months.
In July, Bulgaria 's national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first figure above zero since October last year, when it was positive (0. 2%).
Annual average inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0. 8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101. 9% compared to the previous year and average monthly inflation was 1. 0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0. 2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0. 2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, July 2016 saw a rise in prices for the following categories of consumer goods: meals and non-alcoholic beverages (1. 7%) transport (1. 8%) entertainment and cultural activities (6. 3%) hotels and restaurants (1. 2% domestic goods and services (0. 3%).
Prices fell for clothes and footwear (2. 2%) for domestic appliances, domestic appliances and regular house care (0. 5%) for health (0. 1%).
Prices remained at last month 's levels for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Dear Stankevich: Time comes and the truth comes upwards.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia 's metropolitan Yanuan Stankevich said in an interview with the Independence Party that if we want to win life, the message of Evangelia must be put at the centre.
The force of truth is greater than the whim of evil.
Many are already on the way to hosting the festivities in Aglona in the Marjiang Airport.
What message will the believers get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been expressed by the Pope 's Nuncium.
It is therefore up to him to have the main message.
It is also a kind of tradition that the Krusta Road is led by Bishop Janis Bulis.
He will also send out his own message.
I preside over the previous day with the service of the festival vignette.
Last year I addressed Pope Francis 's encyclical Laudato si and updated the common house, the theme of the earth, in the Latvian context.
This year... I am, of course, watching what is happening in the world and I am trying to respond to this in my address.
My approach coincides with the suggestion of the Church that the message of Evangelia should be put at the heart of life.
It must be shown that Evangelics respond to the most painful problems in people 's lives and give him inspiration on the way forward.
Then it addresses people.
But at the Channel debate, you said that 'to return to the awareness of the full man'.
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that man has turned away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
A man who died on the sidelines of the Indian capital is being plundered.
Nobody in the Indian capital has any sympathy for a man killed on the edge of the road - it turns out that he has put an hour on the sidelines of the road and then was robbed, the BBC said.
A man who has been identified as Matimol has been running on a daily basis and working as a guard at night.
Matification 5: 30 in the morning went to the home by road when he was shot down by a passenger car.
The watchdog 's record shows that the driver went out of his car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour when nobody has been looking at a vicious man, he has been robbed by a garney.
Around 90 minutes after the shooting took place, police came in and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died from the injuries.
Inga Kolegova, Director-General of the State Environment Service (SRS), has saved the government from falling, according to Professor Ojās Skudra, an association of the Social Science Faculty of the University of Latvia.
The Kolegova 's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the controversy in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
In a conversation with LETA, SUnity will support Kolegova 's candidacy next week.
Consequently, if the Unity ministers were to vote 'no' and Kolegova were to hold office anyway, this would lead to the government 's resignation.
According to the expert, Colegova has consulted both Finance Minister Dan Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mars Kucinski before announcing the withdrawal of the candidacy.
At the same time, it is also a concession to Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether it will be possible to find a suitable candidate through a call for proposals, Scudra acknowledged that there are two options: either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution will continue to be guided by Dace Peleka as Director General.
At the same time, he said that if the finance minister hitherto said he would not consider another candidacy, this would be a sign to Peleka that he could not participate in the competition.
As reported, Kolegova, head of the State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the Revenue Service 's Director-General.
On Tuesday, the government postponed the approval of Kolegova as the Revenue Service 's director-general for a week.
Following the government 's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she was still ready to become head of the Revenue Service.
However, she later changed her thoughts - in an application to Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozola on Friday, she says she is withdrawing her consent to the transfer to the Revenue Service and that she has no easy choice.
As reported, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis 's spokesperson Andrejs Vaivars told LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant Director-General of the Revenue Service.
An accident involving a police car occurred in Riga.
A road accident involving the State Police car occurred in Riga this afternoon.
The police car has rushed to the top-class call for air and light signals, while Critican Barona and Dzirnavu have come across another car.
Police are explaining the circumstances, but preliminary information suggests that the other game has not missed the police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
Population in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year, 638 784 residents were registered in Riga, which is 0. 34% lower than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Board (CSP) told LETA.
In terms of population, Latvia 's capital city ranks 30th among EU capitals and large cities with over one million inhabitants.
According to Eurostat, the EU statistical office, Riga has the highest proportion of women, with the capital of Latvia firmly in the first place among Europe 's largest cities, with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic States, there is the highest proportion of women in Europe 's largest cities: 123 in Vilnius and 121 in Tallinn for 100 men.
The LNM will provide a warning pictogram.
Warning signs will be displayed in the coming days at the National Arts Museum (LNMM) near Latvia, as Baiba Gailite, spokesperson for the Riga City Council 's property department, told LETA.
The muzese-style rapid repair of the damage caused by the sceutrophist activities has now been successfully completed.
This will be part of a warning pictogram in the coming days.
Its citizens will be told that the cover tends to be slippery rains and during snow, that it must not be transported by cars, and that it must be accompanied by bicycles, runguns and runoffs.
Ushakov also wrote on Facebook at the time that he said that there was no damage to safety, but that "it appeared nearby," and the sesthebishops "will have to snow."
Greater children and grandparents - New children 's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
During this summer 's season, Riga local government has installed two more playgrounds in the city, Chipsala and Chiekurkala, which are now open to children.
A large, multifunctional rotag vessel with various stun elements, bridges, games, trawls and salt mountains is installed on the Cologian beach.
The playground is aimed at children of all ages.
The cells and the various balancing elements are also installed in agriculture.
The world of Fanthryia is the position of a mineral of small sailors on the coast of Daugava with a view to a passenger port and cruise ships there.
On the other hand, a match-building, batuts, laden trawl, balance bridge, cell, rotame bombs and other game elements have been fitted in the playground between Chiekurkalna 4 and 5, as well as a vinification zone with purse-seine and coordination exercises, cookies, etc.
Intended rubber cover in different paints.
Until the playground on the street, a new paint paint paint cover is loaded.
The hunt reveals a reconstructed road section.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, Latvian National Roads (LVC) management of VAS, as well as representatives of the construction company Binders and local authorities, today opened the section of the reconstructed state 's main motorway Russia (Grebnyev-Rneekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania border (Medumi) (A13) from the Medums to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are a national visit card, especially on border roads, so it is particularly gratifying to open a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds, the situation on the country 's main roads is improving.
"As predicted, the funds available for roads in this programming period will be released already in 2018, and we need to think about how to maintain the most congested roads of high quality and also ensure the mobility of residents in all regions of Latvia without EU funding," said Uldis Augulis, who turned the symbolic ribbon.
Transport Minister also said that the proposals made by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia 's roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Between the Media and the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05km) the construction works were launched by SIA Binders last year and were continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The roadside under reconstruction has been fully renovated and repairs will start in the next period of next year, from the media to Daugavilij itself, so the whole road will be put right from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpilij," said Janis Lange, president of the board of the LVC.
The main roads in the country are the most burdened and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in a good state.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring periodic maintenance in good time and by replacing the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require appropriate funding and everyone looks forward to the proposals put forward by the group of experts to put the road financing system in place," said Lange.
The project arranges road connections and lighting in the Media Centre.
Significant land works are being done: in four phases, large-scale dispersion and large-scale injection and embankment work, a balanced longitudinal profile, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a reconstructed landmark for public transport has been rebuilt.
In the past, there was insufficient stairs and the topography of the areas was not transparent due to the mountainous valleys and the old road to a common topography.
The next construction season is scheduled to restore the road section from the Daugavpils city border to the now refurbished section (144.80-156.40 km).
This year, the LVC plans to carry out different types of work on more than 1,100 kilometres of national roads.
All repair work planned for the national road network this year is available on the LVC website: www.enceli.en
"The right choice of food combinations is essential in order to achieve the desired weight reduction results," said Laura Romeraite-Alfrelieriene, a Lithuanian dietologist.
Moreover, it is easy to do during the summer period, when fresh fruit, berries and vegetables grow up in our own gardens.
Smart dietary combinations can help not only to reduce overweight but also to promote the various organism processes in a targeted manner.
Macaroni and vinegar are successful combinations because they provide a lasting sense of satiety and help to combat fats.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition magazine have shown that the label has a positive impact on the level of glucose in blood and helps us feel cheerful.
Cormorant peppers and protein rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, not only generate a sense of satiety but also reduce carrots after large meals in the coming meals.
Such a combination of food can also increase the calorie content of meals to up to 35%.
Studies show that the Kai peppers can help to get rid of the fat in the vicinity.
Eggs contain a nutrient - choline - that stimulates metabolism, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of these nutrients can reduce the level of cortizol and therefore the accumulation of fats around the middle body.
A breath bottlenecks, accompanied by fresh berries, are another burning meal of taste and fats for breakfast, which is worth including on its menu.
Cherres and berries contain fibres which, according to Canadian scientists, control digestate - appetitested hormone - and thus the sense of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are palliative in terms of weight reduction, as well as preventing the appearance of fats.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to work miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of generating a sense of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fibres and therefore contribute to a sense of satiety.
At the same time, protein is slowing down the digestive process and providing a sense of satiety for a longer period.
You can eat a chicken with sweet or make protein cocktail from a finished mixture in lunch and enjoy it with your favourite vegetables.
Which product combinations should be avoided.
The fruit consists of sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, starch in vegetables is polyaride.
The fruit is distributed mechanically, while chemically, it does not decompose it until it reaches a third or fourth stage in the digestive process taking place in sarnies.
The starch is split into three different stages, starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the ice immediately after the meal.
To eat the ice straight after the meal, it is dressed in the brush with other meals where it is not chemically distilled and is beginning to be blown.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers or other carbohydrates with citrons, luck, or or oranges or other acids.
Ensom ptialin, contained in salts, operates only in a alkaline environment.
Fruit acid hinders not only the distribution of carbohydrates, but also contributes to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein products in the same meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and times to be ingested.
Arcture, medusmelone, footwear and other melons must always be eaten separately from other meals.
Melones are not remotely produced if they are in brush with other foodstuffs.
Fats combined with protein-rich products.
People make a successful combination with solids, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein: fat hinders protein production.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of protein products is consumed, evade the entire use of fat.
This also applies to freshing - it is not advisable to combine large quantities of nuts (containing protein) with a whole source (containing fat).
This combination hampers effective weight reduction.
How can we be better prepared?
"Cooking, thermic treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - around 15% to 55% of the original nutrient content of the products," the dietology says.
In most cases, nutrients are going to disappear by collecting food in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods is increasing, particularly in the form of weakness.
After the gateway, it is advisable to use the remaining liquids for cooking soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients that are left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is advisable to make the gardens in vapour as well.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of liopene contained in tomatoes.
Smoking tomatoes for 30 minutes increases by 25%.
Thermonuclear treatment also greatly increases the bioavailability of betacarotin, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, burms, sweet potatoes and tears.
The thermic treatment of eggs and meat strips away the natural properties of the proteins present in them, making them more readily removable.
The thermic treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb into an organism.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamins C from 10% to 90%, whereas the freezing of the fibre does not affect it.
The combination of rivers with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle performance.
Our organism takes up to 33% of the less cardiovascular iron found in plant products such as beans, leaf greenhouses, cereal products, than the blood iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-cardiovascular iron into the body by using products containing non-blood iron, together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change the ne-blood iron so as to make it easier for our organism to absorb it.
Iron is necessary for the production of chemoglobaline, which provides oxygen in muscles and in the brain.
To gain maximum benefit from salts, add healthy fats such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing butter bread, add vitamin D to the rich salmon or sardine free yoghurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the odd and plays an important role in the bone formation process.
Auzas (as well as other whole cereals) together with vitamin C sources, such as strawberries, rivers, raspberries and other fruit or coal, help stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid arteries being dragged.
Sæchat Anime criticizes the "Chechnya" effect
The Sæchat representatives say that this film has been inspired by anilation, but some commentators say it is racist insensitivity.
With this slow-down effect, Sæchat allows 150 million users to change reality in a rather absurd way on a daily basis and to play with their own identity.
You can turn yourself into an analogue, a dog or an image belonging to the Royja Lihštenstein painting.
The clothes are foolish, images crippling instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfies per day.
Any error shall quickly become public.
The Sæchat lenses effect has been criticised in the past, with the accusation that the application promotes too black or gay shadows like a tale of ideal beauty.
This week, the new scrap effect was published, which allows users to build a hammer 's eyes, toothbrush and round stars, and some critics called it a racist Asian caricature - the yellow Gigs.
The question was also asked as to whether such discrepancies do not suggest that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public negazines erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard said that the rainy effect had been taken out of taxation.
The company said that the aim of the lenses was to portray the image of Anime rather than caricking people of Asian origin.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects have recalled the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the likelihood of Anime.
Greis Sparapani, an American art student, of Korean origin, wrote on Twitter about pictures as a massive resonance, and she says in an email that the rainy effect was "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least."
She went on to say that it is difficult not to see the obvious similarity between aziate cartoons and lenses.
This shows that the effect of lenses is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face of racism.
Sæchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And the large audience of young people, who represent different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
"Such things do not go unnoticed today," Keitija Žou, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Medium product manager Žou deleted his application and recommended that others do the same.
In her article, Medium and telephony, she explained that she believed that problems related to race arise because of the employment policy of Sæchat, which is not sufficiently supportive of racial diversity.
It criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then closed its article with a reference to #DeleteSæchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so there are decisions like this, whether some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take such a position as to be able to express their opinions safely and comfortably," says American Jou of Chinese origin.
Her views are shared by others, while Sæchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many employees are represented by different races, stating that it is a private company.
Sæchat refused to discuss the origin of its workers, but its spokesman said that the company had instructed a staff member who would focus on the representation of racial minorities in the company, which are not widely represented and would facilitate entry into the company.
"I wonder if they really need more users like us to realise that it is not right," he said.
The congressional chamber said the military officials had distorted the reports of the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the congressional chamber says that the US Central Command has distorted the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
Analysts from the Central Command Intelligence Service are generally dissatisfied with the interim report of the mission unit set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Financing Subcommittee, pointing out that their leadership controlled reports of Americans 'progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report shows that the intelligence reports approved by the high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US fight against terrorism more favourably than in fact: the facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses have shown.
Centcom 's actions are unacceptable: it is our soldiers who suffer if our policy-makers receive false reports.
Centcom 's management errors lie at the top of the organisation.
This 10-page report details the existing problems in the coverage of the Central Command and analyses of the American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration would have been misled by reports, it shows that the Centcom leadership has exerted some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration press, communications and reports to Congress represented the situation in a significantly more positive light than was actually the case.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly stated that Mosul 's recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq 's second largest city still under Islamic State control.
Maiks Pompeo, a representative of the Casa Republican Party, says in her report: 'The investigation over a number of months clearly states this'.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, chief officials of the US Central Administration distorted the reports, depicting the ISIS threat in Iraq as weaker as they were.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by further findings on the matter.
The Chief Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence is conducting an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they concur with some of the conclusions of the working group of the Republican Party.
In her report, Democrat Adams Šifs said that between 2014 and 2015 Centcom had too limited the preparation of intelligence assessments in connection with ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Schifa explains that this process 'stopped the dissemination of information', worsened the ethics of analysts and 'spread facts that were untruthful'.
But Siff and Democrat party members added that there is no evidence that White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draft reports in line with "a pre-defined or political position."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress 's investigation on Thursday.
The New York Times said in August that the Pentagon Inspectorate has opened an investigation following complaints from the analysts of Centcom.
Pentagon 's spokesman Patrik Evans said that Pentagon would not comment on the congress 's report until the investigation continues.
He also said that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways and that the Defense Ministry and intelligence agency called for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation goes beyond the question of whether the American-led bombardment campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (an allegation made by an increasing number of Defence Ministry representatives).
But the accusations of last year call into question whether President Obama can rely fully on the reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamist intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade of events when Gregorium Houker, a Centcom intelligence analyst, said that the Bush administration launched an Afghan war with too little thought of its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in the discovery of Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Houker team found that, in contrast to public reports, air strikes to Islamic State Oil factories had not seriously worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Authority.
At that time, the Centcom Commander General Loids Ostins III received harsh criticism, as many lawmakers believed that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April General Ostins was on leave and his place was taken by General Jozefs L. Votels.
The United States is winning the fourth consecutive victory in the US duel with Britain in the Women 's Hockey.
Keitija Bama scored the first two goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan on Thursday for the U.S. Women 's Hockey League (WFC), while the Americans scored the first two goals in a 3-0 victory over Japan.
Five goals in two games are an inconceivable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said he could not remember, or what she would ever have been successful.
She said: 'I have no idea'.
I am not one of those people who are counting their gates.
But she knows that the Americans 'result for the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them an inseparable distinction in their group with Britain, which on Thursday left a 2-0 victory over Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the first round of the matches.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter and the game will be determined by the team 's first place in the six-league and second place in the team.
The first prize went on to avoid a slightly longer meeting with the strong Dutch class, the leader of the second group.
While not watching Saturday 's match, the Americans have already called a surprise, with four years ago in London the last place among the 12 teams.
There were also Bama in the team.
She grew upstairs in Blub, the field hockey canvas for the first time in her hands at the age of 3 (her grand-daughter nurse was already playing this sport in Dreksela) and the national team joined when she was 16 years old, becoming the younger player in the history of the rankings.
She did not go to the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not get into the finals.
But 2012 was unfortunate for her and her team.
Next year, English Kregs Parhama was appointed as a coach and things changed for the better.
It was called 'cultural, mentality and physical change'.
We did not invest as much work as we did now in London.
We have changed everything.
Bama opened the game on Thursday with a gateway in the first half of the season.
India opened the game without victory in its own account, but their team was very tough and held a minimum result at the end of the 0: 1-3 period, when Bam scored his goals again.
She inaugurated the ball in the left-left-leaning champion, saw the middle of the square and set off the ball in the anti-American champions with 2: 0.
Melisa Gonzalesa scored one more goals in the middle of the fourth period.
This was the first US DJeky Bridge game in each of the first three games.
She has run out.
And also Bama.
"We are going very well now," said Pahama, but how good will we show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing meal for the transitional period is the St Maltese
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Mr Delano Rūzvelts sat in the ovation room to detain the meal.
President ūzveta tastered fine culinary delicatees such as the geese pastēte or fuagle and the battlefield of Meriland turtles.
But his meal was much more modest on the day: his egg was ripped in the tomatoes, the potato thicken and the desert of the floodgates.
Jinina Ziegelman says: 'This is a way of showing solidarity with people who were very hard on cooking meals'.
Her husband, Andrju Kou, adds: 'This is also a message to the Americans how they should eat'.
A couple of Brooklyn Heights is food historians.
The last book "Dry of Lords" describes Chinese kitchen in America and Ziegelmane describes life through the building hall in the eastern Lower Manhattan in its book "97 Awles."
Their new joint work, the St Maltese, which will be published by the Harper on Tuesday, is a story about the American food during the Great Depression.
By showing a certain degree of solidarity in the gastronomy, they kept the meal together in the Eisliu 's Sandwich Shop, a simple meal in the town of Flatirona, operating from 1929, when the great depression began.
Ms Ziegelman, aged 54, ordered a butter 's butter with a carpet cheese and grained olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered turkeys, potato thickness and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a fake lake, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to the conversation on the Eating of the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmane said that the fake lake was very popular.
There was a lake, a liver and a puppet lake.
They were made of basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Think how it is: eat so much peanuts in place of lunches.
Mr Kou wiped out.
"It probably seemed that the wind was full of lead," he said.
In the years leading up to the depression, the American lunchtime table appeared to be the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat their man-workers and in breakfast, in lunches and dinner, fresh biscuits were given.
It was the Americans who sent meals to Europeans during the first World War.
"At that time, the food became the main focus of the American people 's daily attention," said Mr Cou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write exactly on this subject.
Equally important became the diet of the new budget: unknown meals, such as the fake lake and disiners, became everyday, indignation was an "excellent way to use surpluses," Ms Ziegelman said, as the cooks could conceal the unattractive ingredients under the chairmanship.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the main component of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, unprecedented formations were born.
In an old book, Mrs Ziegelmane came up with a recipe for preparing a tiny butter with peanuts.
Mr Kou said: 'It was not a popular addition to the lunch table'.
Mrs Ziegelmane underlines: 'This was surreal'.
The low-nut butter and the concept of a small pot are incompatible.
Many household food prescriptions adapted to difficult times.
Household economists such as Luise Stenley, Head of the Federal Household Economy Office from 1923 to 1943, established national eating habits that were not experienced before or after the Great Depression.
In publishing articles and prescriptions in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that housewives become "economists" and take up challenges such as turning macaron and carrot microns into a mental meal.
The St Maltese is a emblematic of historical spirituality.
Especially interesting is the testimony to the government 's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Haver 'let me eat the cake'.
Although he spoke in public about his simplistic childhood and food in Aiova, he actually eaten as a fine millionaire he had become.
What Mr Kou says: 'He liked Europe 's kitchen, such as fish with cucumbers'.
He eaten almost in a golden waiter wearing lunchtime jets.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Rukeletes would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
According to the book, Riga captured a domestic worker who was not taught to eat, thus the White House became "the place where not only one of the longest food in Washington, but also the worst prepared meals" was delivered.
As soon as the country 's economy recover, most of the depression era 's culinary was usually lost.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition and how to apply science in gastronomy, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
The story tells us that, when they write the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating habits of Mrs Ziegelman, for example, why she was unable to throw out the food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," he said.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said: 'She was actually anxious to the people'.
Sometimes there was an incident with wind insects.
When we had eaten the Eisenberg building, a couple of writers were pulling out a desert made from the bags home: the floodplains that President Rupelt used to eat in lunch.
"It 's a flash dust," said Ms Ziegelmane, adding that at the time the habit was common to give thoughtful food a shake name.
There are no bottlenecks, only dried floods, little flour, sugar, water and canal.
Everyone was impatient in the brown mask that was on the plate.
Surprisingly, it was not so bad.
Mr Kou eaten a few more cheeses.
Looking like an experienced economist, he said to his wife: 'Derrick snowball a lake nut'.
Gilead to be repaid for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for the Hepatite C patent
A parcel judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to be reimbursed for the services of lawyers that it paid in the case of the dissolution of the Hepatitis C patent against Merck & Co Inc by the pharmaceutical company.
In June, Gilead was acquitted with a penalty of 200 million pounds for breaking two Merck patents, which threatened it with the success of Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a US federal judge found abuses in Merk 's activities, such as blasphemy and other unethical activities.
"Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal costs that it has incurred in this case," said US regional judge Bets Labsons Fümman.
Merck is trying to take a market position against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation Hepatitis C, which is effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other seeking ownership of the new active component sopbuvir, which is the main component of the Gilead medicinal product.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken control of the city of Manbidge from the Islamic State.
U.S. forces have taken full control of Manbidge 's northern city on Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldier has fled the city, the group 's spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city from the last opposing militants who have not left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostages - civilians captured by militants, Sharf Dares told Reuters, from the military council of the SDS ally Manbidge.
"The city is now under our full control and we are searching for the militants," Reuters told reporters.
Clinton 's income reached USD 10.75 million in 2015 and a couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton issued a tax declaration on Friday 2015, showing that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband earned USD 10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Clinton has donated USD 1 million in 2015, mostly to his Clinton charities, and former President Bill Clinton earned approximately USD 5.3 million, acting as Speaker and former Secretary of State, earned $3 million from his book on work in the State Departamenta, published in cooperation with Simon & Alfrester.
Clinton 's election ally Tims Kein and his wife, Anna Holtone, have published their tax return for the past 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tims Kein continue to set new standards of financial transparency," Clinton 's campaign partner Jenifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind various pretexts and excuses so that promises to disclose his tax information are not honoured.
Disclosure of nominal tax information is a practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by the law.
New York Business Manager Trump and his lawyer mention the State Revenue Service 's audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your march," Ian Sam, a partner of Clinton 's campaign, said in his Twitter account, about the taxes of the Democratic Party candidate.
Trump 's Special Advisor Michael Nen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax information before completing his audits.
Trump 's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, Mits Romney, and others, say that his refusal raises questions about his real assets, the amounts of donations and other business ties, including those with Russia.
Clinton poured the oil fence by publishing a video on Friday, where a number of influential voices are demanding Trump to disclose his tax details.
She returned to the issue again during an economic speech on Thursday in Mičigan.
She told the crowd: 'He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades'.
According to Politico, in the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no tax in the last two years, and the author of a business column in the New York Times on Friday said that many accountants and lawyers believed that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the proposal of the billionaire Varena Bafeta, promotes the idea that anyone earning more than USD 1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
During his speech last week in Omah, Nebragous, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also present, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Bafet said he was also being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
Clinton 's campaign has publicised tax information up to 2007.
Hillary Clinton now lives in Chelva, New York and between 2007 and 2014 has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent.
Clinton 's 2015 tax survey shows that, unlike most Americans, only USD 100 of their income is paid.
Their main contribution was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

The Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin for the dissolution of Israel 's distant code at the request of an archaic: RT News
The French film-maker of Jewish origin broke a storm in social media when he discovered that there was no Israeli televised code available at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, based on an appeal from Arab clients.
Klods Lancmans, director of the Holocaust Shoah documentary, did not conceal his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancmans tried to find a list of Israeli distant hotels.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which it can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
Message Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call it through its call centre.
The regime asked for clarification from the hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer he received was 'shocked'.
The house 's administrator explained that "this was an informed decision of the hotel 's management."
The reason for the withdrawal was even more anxious for the film-maker.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be extinguished," Lanzman quoted the hotel worker 's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsmans, called this case 'a big shame'.
We are surprised and shocked by the incident.
That, in itself, is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened precisely in Germany is a further downgrading in this network of hotels.
No clarifications are needed.
The official said: 'We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions'.
This event also had a quite extensive effect on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply plunged Arab customers.
Somebody else said "shame," saying the hotel was on the Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel said the hotel itself quickly rejected all the accusations, saying that all this was "a misunderstanding" and apologised to Lancman.
"We have not received any direct instructions to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung cites Kempinski.
Admittedly, the code is again added to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against Brazilian students protesting.
Students and police clashes took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education reforms.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the ombudsmen tried to expel students, which led to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their dissatisfaction with the reform of the education system.
Geraldo Alckmina, Governor of San paulu, proposes the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators marked a wall with messages against interim President Maiklu Temeru.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered during demonstrations to support the suspended President, Dylan Rousefai, for which the anthem voted in favour.
Scotland Skiners finishers first, bringing Britain to cycling gold medals
Scanders at the Scottish finisher for the first male cycling team in Rio Bicycle, which took place last night; the British club saved the title it won in 2012 London.
The 23-year-old athletes from Glasgow played an important role in these matches, making the legendary Scottish Srisu Holy proud and bringing the favourite New Zealand out.
Four years ago, Britain won a staggering victory when Holy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the London World Cup, even though Hoy had already finished his athletes career.
There were problems between the Beijing and London Olympic Games because of the need to replace the experienced start-up specialist James Staff.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When Holy went, he was trying to fill the seat in Kian Emadi and Met Krampton.
The British trainers had expectations of the Skiner, seeing their potential, which he later proved.
Hindus, Kenyyy, who started with Holy and Skiners four years ago, inaugurated the record of the Olympic qualifier, but the New Zealand team had a better start.
However, the British trio obtained gold medals.
Hindus was in close proximity, Kenya came to the fore and Skiners safeguarded the leadership.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as the Hindu drive with more carry-overs to allow Kenya, and Skiners in particular, to move more quickly.
Holy watched the matches as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinera, Kenya and Hindesa at the moment they were going to the podium.
The 23-year-old sagour said: 'It was an unspeakable honour'.
I am doing everything to defend my name.
In the finals we install the Olympic record and won the World Cup.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better win.
After winning with Kenya and Holy in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the Hindus was told that they had deliberately fallen to a trawl after the failed start.
He later rebutted the comment and the British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
This time, however, there were no incidents.
He said: "British flags in the rostrum recalled London."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a cohesive team.
We have lost so many of the world championships, so the victory for the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will be in competition for a country that obtained seven of the ten golden medals of cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the result in Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of Hoja in obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
To Kenya, this would mean six battled gold and one silver medals, and Kenya was born on 23 March (it seems to be the holy day of the British, because Stis Regreivs, Mo Farah and Rodžers Banisters have also been born this day).
On that date, Holy was also born.
Kenya 's next races are a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athletes from Bolton said: 'I am just enjoying all of this at the moment.
The trip is always the best.
For then you can win together with your team members.
To be honest, it is a little one to win. "
He said: 'If he gets two more golden medals, he should be appointed as a weapon'.
That day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlijs Dowin, Eds Klensiy, Steve Burk and OveIN Douls scored the fastest qualification period for four-kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The global record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and finale will take place today in the second half of the day, where Nureen will certainly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip he had disagreements with the Commission when the judges called him to measure his height.
Today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Archibalda set a new record of 4: 13.260 on a women 's trip that will end today.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same successes in Rio.
In the meantime, a number of people have gone behind the scenes, with the charges of sexism and violation of dignity, the technical director of Yukins Saton has resigned, and Hoy and Viktoria Bendleton have also finished their careers.
But at the start of the first bicycle race, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland slaughterhouse is becoming uncertain because an ambitious agreement is being broken.
The aluminium rubbish and the future of hundreds of its workers in Portland, Victoria, have become uncertain, as its main customer, the energy company, has announced a breakdown of cooperation.
This statement is based on the plans of the government of Viktoria to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital in order for the company to continue its work.
20 years of subsidies will be phased out in November.
As a result, more than 2 000 jobs at the Alkoas Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2 000 jobs could be at risk, both direct and indirect.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the slaughterhouse consumes around 10% of all the electricity supply in Viktoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry slaughterhouse, which led to the discontinuation of the Anleseas power plant.
The alknives Portland slaughterhouse works with losses and can be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation over the rising value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The energy supplier of the plant, AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Ielea, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power stations belong to the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies are also part of the company.
AGL hopes to continue the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies for the slaughterhouse, "said the spokesman.
AGL said contracts were so-called "risk restrictive contracts" that are expected to enter into force as of November 2016.
Contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the 2017 fiscal year, "said the company 's representative.
From 2018 onwards, the potential impact of fiscal year on profits is constrained by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
According to AGL, losses have already been reckoned at $187 million, with contracts expected to be terminated.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate contracts will not affect Alcoa 's ability to continue its operations or supply its energy to the slaughterhouse.
U.S. company says it has concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years in 2010, but will be terminated in November, as it does not explain why it will stop cooperating.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the possible closure of the Portland slaughterhouse in Viktoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
Steve Mikelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate that 600 megavatus and Tomago 900 megavatus are being used in Portland over a year.
If these two plants were to leave the energy market, the demand for energy would decrease considerably.
And that would not be a good thing at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year and the situation could get worse as the budget falls.
Three out of five people in Quinnice - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal evictions, are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that cuts in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
Jos Farel, Director of the Legal Centre for Xineland, said the latest Association Report of the National Legal Centres said that legal aid was being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mrs. Farel said that if this decision is not annulled, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre of the siege is constantly underfunded, meaning that the aid is refused to thousands of people in need'.
People who seek to end violent relations have problems of a legal nature and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent, meaning that many thousands more people in the KWland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Xwinelender Senator George Brandis to immediately stop cutting funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and the Government of Palazuka to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump 's campaign has been taken to court because one of the staff has fired a firearm
New York: Donalda Trump 's campaign organisers have been sued for failing to act with information that its chief of operations in North ina opened a firearm against a worker when they travelled in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a court case brought by Vincent Bordini, a former campaigner, before the Sharp Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for this case to be opened internally, but said that this would not happen.
Drivers Errl Filips "pulled the pistol, put his correction finger on the meat and opened the barrel against the pistol," Bordini said in his complaint.
He also claims that, by lodging complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"The weapons should not be fired in order to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was brought, the Republican candidate created a scandal in the post of president, declaring to the people that 'The Second Amendment People', i.e. the owners and enthusiasm of weapons, would be able to act if his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges were to win the elections.
Trump 's campaign representatives said the media had broken out his words from the context and he never incited anyone to violence.
Bordini is seeking compensation from campaign organisers for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines for attacking, illegal use of weapons and creating emotional stress.
Trump 's Houpa Hix did not comment immediately.
The Philippines has failed to communicate.
WCCB, the Sharp local news agency, says the Philippines has recently left the campaign.
Nor has he been able to call his consultancy firm "Innovation consultancy services."
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has conducted a controversial election campaign.
The case of Bordini against the Campaign Committee Donaldu J. Trump For President Inc. "16-CS-14300, General Court, Supreme Chamber of the Court of Justice of Mecklenburg (Sharlotes).
A new tradition: paste and sports festivals in Cologne.
On Saturday, for the first time in Cougal, people gathered on the paste and sports festivals.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that Ezera 's festival would cease to exist.
A new page has now been reversed.
The day started with a sports competition.
This time, the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, the horrors had to be thrown into a sleep target, the boat was flying, with the hand of the human left, the 'bombings' have not been at all in the Olympic Games.
Each participant could, however, show how strong, brave, brave and sensible he is.
After the sport matches, everyone gathered in open-air lakes where they started their sleep.
In the meantime, there was also a 'baby corner' where the little was able to plug into infamous excavation and get a new image in the floor.
A new thing that could also become a tradition was the parade of a wheelling gear, which was driven by both tractors and motorcycles.
Inga Kadiķe-Skadina, the head of the Church Street Managing Authority, who ordered a lovely rest and dry weather, was still raining, but it was not able to interfere much.
The villages continued to greet the youngest inhabitants of Cologne.
It is indeed good that five girls and one pupil have been added to the taste.
There were arts of amateur arts coming from the Engueres - spectators very much liked the "Rudens ritmi" of the ancient dance group, the performance of the decree performers "Redas" and of young daughters "Golta Spirits."
And it was nothing that wet looked at the scene at some time.
Of course, the famous activist dozens of Janis Phana and Dainis Porgants were happy for local people and villages, who were once again Milinkevich and Clean Krganina, as well as the wife of Berzvila from the fishermen 's backy 'Days'.
"It 's a great deal to do," he said.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, I believe, makes Heathrow very attractive, as we did in London in 2012, where we put a huge amount of work into ensuring that all the regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratforda and Istanda obtained a huge amount from the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to the youth unemployment in Heathrow.
Just like the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
People said then that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global failure.
Skepticists were wrong for 2012 and they will not be right in the case of Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion, creating the soil for both employment and experience at that airport and the whole of Britain.
There is an excellent team working in Heathrow, which has created an investment programme of EUR 11 billion worth of infrastructure, with a time frame and a budget beginning with a terminal of 5, which has been termed the best airport terminal in the world for five years, to a terminal 2 built between the two more intense runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of EUR 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were an excellent success, and I am sure that will be the expansion of Heathrow as well.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment of which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Deiton is a board member of Heathrow and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of the Economy.
In Switzerland, a woman is running on a highway in an attempt to commit suicide.
What happened in mid-night was on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses in an accident when she was transported by several cars early on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near Morges in Vo Canton.
The canton police report says that, in desperately wanting to commit suicide, a woman had gone to the road in the dark where she had several cars.
Clearly, in trying to kill themselves, the victims, the 49-year-old drivers, were driving several cars, including the lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given testimonies, but others have not yet been cleared up, says police, urging those involved to refer to the drivers and witnesses of the incident.
Criminal investigations have also been opened in the case, which is a logical step in this case, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told the edition of Le Alfreune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers added: 'This will be explained by the public prosecutor'.
Two similar incidents that have taken place over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrian went to the highway in mid-night, so it was decided that drivers could not foresee pedestrians on the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman was acquitted with killing behind the neglect when, in August 2014, she drove a man who slept in the middle of the night on a road A1 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim was drunk and then discovered to sleep.
The court concluded that the policeman who was on the way to the scene of the accident had travelled in an appropriate manner and that the judge admitted that the man on the road was "an entirely unforeseeable and exceptional case."
Anyone with information about Thursday 's accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The internet collects signatures to organise a new competition for the Revenue Service 's head.
The petition on Avaaz.org was launched for the organisation of a new competition for the head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition, addressed to ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (Greens / Farmers), says the public wants a transparent and professional nomination process.
The petition was signed on August 10 and was signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating the Revenue Service 's Director-General, Ingas Kolegova, is non-transparent and non-professional.
This brings to mind the best working tradition of the Soviet Union.
It discourages public administration and once again discourages the public from government and politics.
"There is a need for competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," the text of the petition said.
The author of the report, Janis B. pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria for choosing Kolegova for office.
Nor is the position of the candidate in the Revenue Service clear.
The petition states that the State Chancellery must conduct a new open competition, which actively addresses professional candidates, attracts staff selection specialists and offers adequate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova as the head of the Revenue Service last week, who was supposed to be appointed by the government this week, but all Unity ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played badly.
Alyaksandr Samoilov and Janis Schumann have hoped to be honoured for the Rio Olympic Games, but there is no difference where to win the competition, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world 's strongest beaches scores on Thursday in a 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15) match for Basketball club Evandru Gonsala Oliveir and Pedru Solberg Salgada lost their participation in the four-year major sports forum.
In three matches of the subgroup, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same was the same for two other wins.
The three other small points, which were the most unfavourable to Latvia 's dueteenth in this match, were listed below.
"We had the lead in the first six, but from 16: 15 we also went to 16 points," Smedins remembered the game.
I do not even know how we left the rest of the sixth.
It must not play.
Then it was all right in the second half and the game was broken in the shadows and it should have been a good foundation for the third.
We started it in the same way, but after we changed the parties, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the Group of Commons, all the teams were similar, nearly all three were in all matches, so small points were important.
"It 's better to play the same place than to relay 3-4 points in a row."
We knew that Evandru can be preserved.
"We had 1-2 points in the first six and the third in the third place and the third in the + 4 match," Smedins remembered.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes they came, they did not.
I did not look at the situation before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, I played badly," Samoilovs said.
We expected a good server from Evand and it would be pretty good in the first six, but the third opened the serve for him and it was difficult to build an attack.
I, for my part, made a great deal of mistake right at Pedru serves, but it was up to it.
Samoilovs said that, unlike the previous match, there was no nervous today.
"We married, the game, the defense was as well, but there should have been better acceptance of the serves," the sportsman said.
"They played well and came to the urra in the end."
Before the tournament we said straight away that the spray is the most uncomfortable one could have been.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even out of the group.
"Everyone expected medals from us and we do n 't have any differences either, but then we don 't have a 25th place or a fourth place," Samoilovs said, who predicted that the dozens would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one Turkish.
Samoilovam was in Rio de Janeiro for the third Olympic Games, as he started in Beijing in 2008 with Martin Blair and was playing with Ruslan Sorokina four years ago in London.
In the meantime, he was the second in the Olympic Games.
Latvijasenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of potential dealer.
The state energy company Latvijasenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market, both from the consumer 's position and that of potential dealer, the company 's spokesperson Ivita Bidere said.
"The decision on whether Latvia will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by the type of gas market model and regulatory framework to be established."
"For our part, we are therefore actively involved in the drafting and commentary of the legislation and we are putting forward our proposals," she said.
BNS has already written that the Economics Ministry (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and Latvijas Gaze, has drafted draft cabinet rules for the sale and use of natural gas which will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, ensuring that natural gas users have the right to freely choose the natural gas dealer as of April 3, 2017.
Working on the new framework for the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trade process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the "central model" chosen as the most efficient and user-friendly solution, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader: one contract, one invoice and one point of supply of information and customer service, leaving the technical aspects of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We recall that the gradual opening of the market to domestic customers will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price after April 3, 2017, and thus become connected users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
On the other hand, economic operators will have to opt for a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of a natural gas trade agreement, economic operators will be granted trade in natural gas for a fixed period by the current natural gas dealer at a price.
The draft cabinet of ministers 'rules set out the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users in detail.
The rules provide for arrangements for the supply and termination of natural gas to customers, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified facility for the supply and use of natural gas; the modalities for settlement of the services received, the level of interest due, the switching arrangements for traders and the supply of customers in the event of a natural gas supply disruption; and the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to related customers by the public trader.

Minister: next week, the Revenue Service 's Director General is scheduled to increase his remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) plans to talk with Prime Minister Mars Kucinski (Greens / Farmers) and government coalition partners about increasing the State Revenue Service 's Director General 's remuneration next week.
Reizniece-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Revenue Service 's director-general needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency in order to make the position more attractive to possible new tenderers.
And next week we spoke about changing the conditions for the competition.
The minister also emphasized that she had no thought for a specific candidate to be eligible for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola said that the head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good Director-General of the SRS.
On the other hand, as regards current Revenue Service chief Daci Peleko, who is ready to apply for the post, the minister reiterated that the new Revenue Service Director General should be "from the sidelines" and should not come from the Revenue Service 's structure.
She also said she looked forward to the return to Saeima on leave in order to steer the amendments to the law needed for the reorganisation of the Revenue Service as soon as possible.
BNS has already reported that Inga Kolegova, head of the State Environment Service, has submitted an application to the finance minister, Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai (Greens / Farmers), which withdraws his candidacy for the vacancy of the Revenue Service.
In her application, she said that this was not an easy choice, but over the past two weeks her relatives have been under severe emotional pressure, without having taken any action to condemn the law.
Kolegova also said that her candidacy talks had fuelled controversy among the governing coalition parties, which was not acceptable.
The former Director General of the Revenue Service, Inara Petersone, also resigned at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indexes are increasing in the US and in Europe, as well as in the US dollar.
World oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors 'mood positively influencing the statements of Saudi Arabia 's oil minister, which reinforces expectations that the major oil-producing countries will act at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the world oil market.
The three main index of the US stock exchanges reached record levels on Thursday, which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of a number of large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the financial performance of a large number of companies have also led to an increase in Europe 's stock-indexes on Thursday.
The US dollar grew on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese jen.
In September, the price of WTI mark crude oil for supplies increased by $1.78 in New York stock exchange trading, to $43.49 per barrel.
Brent 's price of crude oil increased by 1.99 dollars on the London stock exchange in October - to 46.04 a barrel.
The turnover of the canning manufacturer Zillagona is falling by 33. 8% last year.
Zillagona, the Canadian manufacturer 's turnover, was EUR 4.202 million last year, which is 33. 8% less than one year ago, while the company 's losses fell 5.7 times to EUR 904.7 thousand, according to an annual financial report published by the Lursoft database.
According to the company 's management report, in 2015, the company dealt with losses due to a number of factors, including a persistent shortage of revolving funds caused by Unicredit Bank 's withdrawal from the Baltic market by terminating the previous credit line and leaving Zilo lagonu unmanageable contracts.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy much cheaper raw materials and receive a reduction in volume.
The bank 's withdrawal from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU structural fund support projects which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise its infrastructure.
The company 's financial creators have also been adversely affected by the rise in commodity prices over the past year and the reluctance of customers to pay more for their products.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price changes and were prepared to purchase the new prices at the highest prices," the company 's management said.
Zillagona also opened talks with potential investors in 2015, including the rating of the company 's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been the largest creditor of Unicredit Leasing, where the parties are familiar with and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the operation and development of the company were positively affected by the implementation in practice of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, enabling greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"A number of equipment was bought to ensure higher production speeds," the company 's management said.
Zillagona 's management notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company 's plant to carry out orders which were previously impossible.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the protocols of intent on the sale of the product have already been signed, all the produced will be sold in accordance with the protocols of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about EUR 300 000 a month, "the company 's management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish to Iraq in August 2016.
Zillagona has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, extended the market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new chain of supermarkets in the United States in September 2016.
As a result of all these measures, the company intends to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Zillagona worked with EUR 6.347 million in turnover and EUR 5.113 million in losses.
Zillagona was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of EUR 1.156 million.
The company belongs to two individuals - Mikhail Kaidanovam (89. 11%) and Igor Širšon (10. 89%).
The film 's sounding Zar Leanderi and the press conference were welcome at the 15-poseum.
Rigas can be seen as the beginning and inspiration of a stranded Christmas Leanderes 's career.
In 1924, the village of Zar Lenderes at the crossroads of Rwant, which was the Swedish Ambassador to Latvia, was found to be fatal in Riga, as she found the unusual low constellation of Zar Leanderes, which she attempted to descend on the Riga Cabinet on the theatre of theatre.
Perhaps it was precisely the accidental love in Riga that became the fatal turning point on the Zar 's creative path towards the world 's massacre.
Riga Zara Leander had warm memories and she hoped to go to Riga at the visitors 'gallery, but unfortunately these hopes were not doomed because the Second World War began.
Using the form of a show, this meeting will be possible in Riga 's festivals in 2016 and in the role of the excellent Zar Leanderes, the great Ieva Kerevica will feel.
There are wide traffic restrictions in the area of Aglona.
In order to ensure the safety of the most sanctimonious entrants in VAS, Latvia 's national roads will be shut down by 18: 00 to 15: 00 from 12 August this year, VAS said.
Stakeholders and public transport in Aglona will not be covered by these restrictions.
It should be noted that, in the P62 Strawall-PreVilnius-Madona section of the motorway, construction works and construction sites at Aglona Street (0.80-4.00 km) will only cross public transport and pedestrians.
For other road users, traffic will be flown by the Driving Road, the scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants arrive on these festivals, including pilgrimage persons.
Drivers must therefore be particularly careful, because there will be intensive pedestrian movement on various road routes towards Aglona.
We call on drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions introduced, to respect traffic organisation procedures and to take account of possible longer travel times.
The water temperature in all water bodies falls below + 20 degrees.
Sovereign water temperatures continue to decline and are now below + 20 degrees in all rivers, lakes and seas, according to the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Center.
In the sea, the wind has dried up to + 16 ° + 18 degrees, with an impact on water temperatures in the western coast of the Gulf of Riga to + 13 degrees Celsius, Roya to + 9 degrees.
In Lieup and Daugava, as well as in large lakes, water temperatures are + 18 + + 20 degrees and other water bodies + 14 + 19 degrees.

The officials said the demonstration was generally calm and protesters finally left the building voluntarily at the request of their staff.
The insurer pays compensation for passengers cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If the insurance has paid compensation to a family for the flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday 10 August, which has resulted in a refusal to attend the planned music festival.
On 11 August, if insurance received a claim for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to travel to the music festival in Belgium but, as the flights cancelled at the airport on Wednesday did not allow this, the customer was calculated to be compensated for the accommodation reservation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the festival tic tickets purchased, amounting to EUR 204.
On the other hand, customers have been promised compensation for the money they have spent on air tickets.
If insurance from all travel insurance has paid compensation in an average of 15% of cases for interruption or cancellation.
"These times reimburse the costs of purchasing, redistributing or exchanging tickets, as well as of booking accommodation," Dagnija Rutka, head of insurance product, told reporters.
As we know, on the evening of 10 August a private aircraft stopped due to technical problems at Riga Airport, so only a number of flights flowing have been cancelled and several arriving flights have had to be rerouted to other airports.
Thanks to the repair of the neighbour, the man is being pushed to the edges and forced to leave the house.
Dmitry Saidyshev, a neighbour who started to repair the capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been throwing its throats from the ceiling and is not convinced that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and the ceiling has been damaged in my apartment.
Then I informed the Riga City Council, the House Manager and other organisations.
The Board of Governors said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any expertise.
"The residential owner must enter the Latvian Union of Inuhetia and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry said.
The guest expert was present, fictised and found that the overcover was unsatisfactory.
However, a month has passed since the first Dmitry application on the building board, and until the beginning of this week, no one was able to answer whether there was life-threatening in the apartment.
In the Construction Board, it is legislation, wait, if you are not happy, write for everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house to the manager, then the house manager to the building council again and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
It is clear, after all the paperwork has been examined, that the construction works have been stopped, although somebody can hear from time to time that they are working there.
Within a further two months, an expert and within six months a residential owner carrying out repairs should be required to remedy all these deficiencies.
The independent expert has drafted his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superfluous.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal compound is affected, so there is no certainty that the subsistence owner is exposed to risks.
"That is why we have requested further clarification from this expert," Ilze Žūka, a spokesman for the Riga City Council, said.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper hinterland, construction continues to be heard from there.
The fine for construction without a building permit is between EUR 70 and 700, but in this case the penalty can be much more severe.
While awaiting an expert 's opinion, the building board decided that the two flats should not be used, both the state of the construction and the Dmitry apartment.
"This is a case in practice of the building council where, in this way, citizens may have been jeopardised not only by their own property, but also by the property owner, as a result of which the owner cannot exploit his property," a spokesman for the building board said.
Dmitry now remains to look for another place where to live - for relatives, friends, hotels or for renting another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover the damage that has been caused by a neighbouring civil law, which can take a great deal of time.
As a result of the arbitrary construction, the residence of both flats is now prohibited until the construction engine delivers its conclusion, and it may have to be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage incurred will have to be paid to the owner of the apartment where the repairs took place.
This residential owner is also threatened with a term of imprisonment of up to six months due to the failure to take account of what has been said by the building board.
I should like to mention this.
How much time is there?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white fields were born in Demidova 's zoodarch near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and sometimes blowers together, despite the fact that the babies are being fed together.
The former redesign of the Chemicals Spurs into a five-star hotel will cost €22 million.
Park Hotel Ķemeri will cost EUR 22 million, Gita Želve, spokesman for Park Hotel Ķemeri hotel, told LETA.
The establishment of a hotel is the first stage in the reconstruction of the former Coemerian sanitation.
The second phase will be wellness, or a consensual clinical, which is expected to be opened in 2022, while the hotel will be opened in May 2018.
It says that the exact costs of a clinical are still unknown.
But she says it will be in the building of the former Catholic Catholics, which has an area of about 12,000 square metres.
The line will be on three lines.
Park Hotel Ķemeri and the contemplated clinical owner are the International G Capital Europe Fund investing in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are a number of investors investing money in the fund, Zelve said.
As G Capital Europe CEO George Jouns said earlier, the former resort 's pollinics plan to invest between €12 and €15 million, totalling more than €30 million.
As reported, over 42 hectares of the site are renovated, access routes and street sections renovated, the interactive building of the natural tourism site, the renovating of the site and the construction of a parking area are being built up by Emila Pavel Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the Jurmala city and an increase in the number of tourists, the Jurmala City Council is planning to mobilise EUR 14.5 million from European Union funds, co-financed with EUR three to four million.
Design work is to be carried out by mid-2017, but construction and repairs will start in the autumn of 2017.
As reported, the incumbent 's Kiremeri complex plans to set up a five-star hotel Park Hotel Ķemeri and a wellness clinical.
However, the reconstruction lasted.
In 2010, Ominasis was also reported to be in regular contact with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to ensure day-to-day technical control in Coemeri, and as early as 2011, the construction of the future German hotel Kempinski will be completed and preparations for the opening of the Kempinski hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Ķemeri confirmed his willingness to buy the property of Ominasis Latvia at auction, but one month later, the winner was found to have failed, as he did not pay for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set at the initial price of the last failed auction, at EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA was informed by the City Council 's representative Ieva Aile, the local government will set up an interactive natural tourism site, paved roads and car parks, with the support of EU structural funds, by signing the protocol.
President Antońenko will give the Order of Three stars to the prosecutor.
President Raimonds Vejonis will bestow Orange III class operatist Alexandrm Antońenko next week, August 16, according to the president 's agenda.
The three star ceremony will take place in the Black galleries House at 13: 00.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko has graduated from Jzepa Mediina Musics College in 1998, which has studied a crowd-amtool game and received song outside Margarita Gruz.
Study at the Vītola Academy of Music of Latvia in Vokai District of Arvivda Lustes.
In 1997 he was singing in the Latvian National Opera Corps and defeated in 1998 with the role of G.F.Hendel in Alčina.
He won the Grand Music Prize in 2003 for his vocal performances at the Operations and Verdi Reiches.
The 2004 / 2005 season has become the most internationally recognised tenderer of Latvia, which is the world 's largest operating firm.

The former NATO commander, Alderlova, has broken the Russian hacker by email.
The Hakeri, who buried the computers of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), allegedly has carried out several other cyber attacks, including rampant emails from the former NATO European force, Filipadlova, and servers from the George Soros Institute of Open Society, said Thursday.
The Hakeri information was published on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, the Briefing correspondence and information about the work of the Sorosa Institute were also included.
Hakers have had access to the Institute 's computers for a whole year.
According to the Bloomberg, these cyber attacks have been carried out by the same hakeri as those associated with the Russian special services who have broken down the DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently examining new sanctions against Russia in response to the break-up of DNC computers.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have to accuse Russia or the Russian authorities of hackers formally attacking the Democratic Party 's servers in a cyber attack.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published in July some 20,000 emails from the DNC computer system, which suggests that Democratic party leaders have sought to damage Hillary Clinton 's former rival Vermont senator, Berne Sandersa, in a campaign to fight for democratic nominations for the presidential election.
As reported by US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which is conducting an investigation into the harassment of democratic servers, as well as other US special services, considers Russia 's involvement in the cyber attack to be almost unquestionable.
Mac: Joko Ono 's presence was threatened by The Beatles.
Paul Makartny said that Joko Ono 's presence had created a sense of danger among the legendary group The Beatles.
The 44-year-old rock star currently maintains good relations with the widow of neck John Lenona, but at a time when she went to the group to visit the record, she was frightened because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harison, Ringo Star, Lennon and Macartnia.
When asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to Rolling Stone 's magazine: 'They are really good'.
We were at risk at that time.
As we wrote, she sat on the guns.
Most groups could not tolerate this.
We were able to do this, but not very well, because we were very tight.
We were not sexist, but girls usually did not get booked, they allowed us to work.
When John started to meet Joko, she did not sit in the room, but in four of us.
The author of Yellow Submarine also admitted that he is now in regular contact with Ringo, a former member of the group, and at times endorses the plans for Apple 's work, but otherwise the Beatles is "out of business."
Asked whether he still meets with the other member of the legendary rock group, Makarthyi told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet in social events and awards.
But I am not at the meetings, I feel a little bit detached from it.
I went away from Apple during a difficult divorce.
I sent John I and I said to the meetings: 'Tell me what everyone says, because I cannot tolerate sitting at the table'.
It was too painful as if we could see our own pets dead.
The company is now working in such a way that I am just listening to all the entries.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venice was once a populated planet
On the basis of NASA 's latest climate models, Venice has once been an inhabitable planet.
The scientists from the NASA Hodard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the history of Veniceus through tools and algorithms, which are also used by climate scientists.
The Model was designed to determine whether Veneran, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, once had conditions similar to the Earth.
Researchers have already pointed out that the slow rate of the return of Venice is due to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venice was once in a plan, an atmosphere similar to the Earth and has turned slowly.
The Model also looks at the former topography of Venice.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on earth, but there have been enough water and geographical diversity to build lives and prevent water from being evaporated.
In the early days of Venice, Sule was 30 percent more bright.
In the GISS simulation, the Venice-Turning model reveals that the bright part of the day lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio said on a press release.
This process heat the planet 's surface and causes a thing that in turn creates thick cloud layers that act as a umbrella to protect the planet from the sun heat.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is in fact a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The Model illustrates the history of Venice, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Even though it was once inhabited, Venice has been subject to too much heat and ultraviolet rays over the years.
Its oceans slapped and the longlines were burned by the ultraviolet rays.
With water completely collapsed, only the carbon dioxide atmosphere of the plan remained, with deadly greenhouse gas - Venera, as we know today.
Researchers published the results of the new Venice Climate Model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patriarch Roy resigns as Avalanche trainer
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and Vice-President Patriar Roy submitted a request, citing a lack of influence in the team 's decision-making process.
Colorado 's Vice-President and Lieutenant General Joe Sakik confirmed the news and said the club would start immediately to seek a new trainer.
"I have been performing my duties as chief coach and vice-president of the Colorado Club 's hockey operations with vigour, enthusiasm and determination for the past three years," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I have thought a great deal during the summer how I could improve the team 's performance in order to give it the bright space it needs and achieve a higher level of performance.
To achieve this, the vision of the Chief Train and Hockey Operations Vice-President must be fully in line with the organisation 's vision.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions have not been met.
On 23 May 2013, Cox contracted Roysa thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
It said that Patriarch had informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him all the best for the future.
In his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014, Roy was identified as the best coach of the League and received the James Adamsa Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but the Colorado club was defeated by Minesota 's hockey club for two years.
The Avalanche closed the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without a second special call from the Western Conference organisers.
Royw scored four Stenley Cup titles, two in Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanche.
North Sea oil Platform workers restart negotiations and postpone their strikes
The workers 'strikes over the wages of the North Sea oil Platform have been postponed as talks have resumed between the two parties to the dispute, the negotiators said.
Periodic strikes are being held on North Sea oil platforms in the Wood Group, which operates the Royal Dutch Shell.
In a joint statement, the Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
A series of full day meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, with the aim of reconsidering the issues at stake.
The trade unions said their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, were against the planned 30 percent cut.
This year, the Wood Group reduced wages for those working in the North Sea by 9 percent because of unfavourable market pressures.
Already in 2014, the company reduced wages for land-based workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has already cut wages for several thousands of people and has announced plans to suspend oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in the run-up to a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain 's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MEP Deiv Andersson met workers 'representatives to discuss one of the most important issues, the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the region 's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone and not individuals individually.
In 2016, nearly USD 1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to the USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Keplers measure the rate of turn of stars in the Pledar stars.
The latest Kaffer Telescopes Mission has helped astronomers to compile the fullest catalogue of stars at the speed of the turmoil in the Pledar Street.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars turn at different speeds in this star and how the speed of the turbulence of stars is attributable to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the stars, the age and even the history of the sun system," world Caltech Infrasarkano Province and Luisa Rebula, a scientist of the Analytical Center, said in a news release.
The star is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars are only beginning to grow in this star, reaching around 125 million years of age.
They are turning at maximum speed.
These growing stars are emitting large amounts of star wind at maximum speeds.
When they reach the magnetic field of stars, they put the stars on the brake.
As the stars become older, their growth rate is decreasing.
Kepler maybe the turn speed of each stars, setting the time between the appearance of a recognisable aster area such as the sun.
The latest catalogue of stocking rates for stars shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
The rebull compares stars with distilleries, more seed disjocers perform pirates at a slower rate than small growth descriptors.
The Rebull says that "Baleta" has shown that the slowly rotating objects are bigger and massively, while faster rotation facilities are very small stars.
Thanks to the close proximity of the stars, this serves as an excellent space laboratory where the characteristics of stars can be compared with the turning speeds.
The Rebull says that Pledar stars is helping to build theoretical models for star seal in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of turning stars is slowing down and the process of complete stopping them.
The Rebull and his colleagues have outlined in detail an analysis of the speed of the Pyzes Street in three new publications which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journalism.
