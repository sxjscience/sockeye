A 28-year-old cap was found in a dead Sanfrancist supermarket
This week, a dead 28-year-old cold, which has recently moved to San Francisco, has been found in a supermarket backroom.
But the river's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to go beyond his brother, saying: 'His lives were finally to improve'.
The cancle found on Wednesday was the supermarket of Vesthostages, a 28-year-old Senate Galicia said, a spokesman for the medical expert in San Francisco said in San Francisco Galicia.
The San Francisco police said that his death was a murder and an investigation is taking place.
"I am proud to have done so," he said, "I am proud to have been in Boston," he said, but he had been working in his dream of Son & Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
The representative of Son & Daughters tells us that the message of his death shocked them and shook them.
"We're a small team that works like a cohesive family and we will miss him a great deal," he said.
At this difficult time, we are in touch with the friends and family of North Korea.
Mr Galicia said that at the beginning, the hero had been naked in the hostees, but in recent times, life has finally improved.
"He went to a new apartment and met a girl," KGO radio.
Mr Galicia says he does not know who I would like to go beyond his younger brother.
He was a good man with a broad heart.
"He always stayed his family by preparing a garly aside and preparing lunch," said Luther Galicia
He never wanted to be involved in the dispute.
He was the brother that adapted the others.
"In the face of everything that has gone wrong in the world, he was an unpacked diamant who died every day," he said.
Anyone who has been informed of what has taken place is called upon to call the SFPD Information Port to 415-575-4444.
New medical strike: call for new protests
Representatives of new doctors call for their trade unions to start their protests in the dispute over the new Treaty.
The British Medical Association of LMA (JAK) for the Medical Association (JAK) is going to ask the Council to support more widespread protests in early September.
The JAK considers that ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the LPA contract.
There were 58% of all members who took part in the vote.
On Twitter, on Twitter, the JAK Council member, Eylene Makcorn, notes that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, the vote of the JAK vote has resulted in full rejection of the agreement and the decision to request new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues. "
In response to the government's silence, the JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the development of new contracts to take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors have taken part in six streams, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
After the vote, rejecting the terms of contract offered by the LPA, as proposed by the BMA, the new medical agent of LMA, Dr. Johan Malawana, resigned.
Prior to meetings with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Dáclamio Hant said that the contract would be concluded with the English medics.
Russia and Turkey: Expirated Alliance?
The men who put the crisis out of the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to interface and announce the end of eight months of war and economic sanctions.
On the other hand, Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish leader in St Petersburg's pile, who had the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, they came in.
Vladimir Putin's hard man looked after and did not provoke silly emotions, even given his customary restraint.
By contrast, Mr Erdogan, Erdogan, at least five times called Putin to be a 'dear friend', a meeting of the day.
I felt the number.
He also said that relations with Russia would not only improve until the level of the pre-crisis, but it will be even stronger.
The newspaper day a newspaper reported that Erdogan had to go as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm arouses controversy.
However, from Putin's radiation, the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first that he mentioned in his address was the removal of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow then reacted strongly.
Putin accustomed Ankara to inspire duns in Moscow's back.
The resolution was even more painful given that it came from the friends of the friend.
It will be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to restore genuine trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has both changed.
For several months, government controlled television has been spreading aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks had been guilty of everything.
The most serious of all was the allegations that the family of Erdogan himself was profiting from trafficking in illegal oil through the Islamic State controlled by the Islamic State.
He denied that himself, of course.
However, the message of St Petersburg is a key message that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of an Ankara from peace reconciliation are obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all the potential friends following the unfortunate coup last month in which he tried to overthrow.
The numerous terrorist attacks also shaken his position.
It is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have caused profound losses, in particular the ban on charter flights, which typically provide for every year the influx of several millions of Russian tourists in Turkish forces each year.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russia's tougher and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are restored.
They are looking for a holiday in the Mediterranean from the season.
As early as this week, national TV has been predicting a drop in fruit and vegetables, as Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
Like the local newspaper, Vedemosti: "Tusists, Tomatoes we."
But the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is anxious to the West for in their view the weak response to the attempted coup.
We can also see dissatisfaction at all of the long-standing negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin's intervention, which is happy to use the situation that Turkey has alienced from the West.
The Russian leader had no doubt over the additional points in the eyes of Ankara by expressing its support for the elected government following the coup.
Take into account that Moscow understands this very well, as it is deeply rooted in the fear of the country's change of regime.
The summit in this luxy-by-sea pill gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as an analyst, the "marginalised alliance," two countries that feel marginalised from the West to join forces.
However, despite the unity of the public, there are still considerable differences between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peace, but in fact, Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose information, both presidents of the press conference said they had not discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey had a determined response to the issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes when a NATO member of NATO had to run the Russian fighting plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
For Memo, the IRB will in future have a support role, the Executive Director of the Bank said.
Outside the Scottish SKB there will be no longer available.
A Ross Map for the BBC Canal in Scotland that the IRB brand was associated with the global ambition of the bank.
It has abandoned these ambitions, as in eight years ago, the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts in branding strategies have used the IRB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from the international sports sponsors, starting with the Set of Nations, and finally with the Host of Vinbldón Endia Mureya.
However, now it has been decided to put other national brands forward.
The Scottish Royal Banka will be available to the clients of Scotland, but it will not be originated.
In England and Wales, all the reference BITs, outside of the main office and on the official stock exchange, will be replaced on the name of NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
A smaller private financial brand, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Raummond and Holt Military Bank, will also be attentive.
The fee was interviewed during the trip with customers and staff on the Invernesset.
He told the BBC Scottish channel: "The SKB will become our brand of investors and work with our employees, because now we are more than a brand bank."
The bank itself became a global brand and the IRB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition; we have local ambitions.
Every one of these brands will represent something unique in our industry and our employees will be working with customers under these brands.
The SKB had already announced that it will not continue to be sponsored by "Six Nations" and will involve different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to become a brand bank, because we have long been asking ourselves the question of how to become a better bank for their clients?
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we said that we would become an excellent bank for our consumers and we will develop these brands.
However, with hard work and focusing on the needs of customers, rather than our own needs, we have obviously achieved a great deal of change.
Once again, we can revive these brands, so I think it is now time.
Her Depository wins a 3000o win over the first place in New Newcak with horse Predilection
The deters corrupt champagne in his 3000th victory twice by the first race in the Newcakek.
On Friday, Job Deters fought his 3000th win in Great Britain's history and the first place in the Newcakek.
He achieved this by fighting the second victory in these race stories in his home city with the Predilection coaching by John Gosusk.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth chamber, which has reached a result in the races of horses.
He has joined the Seram Gordon Ričarddy, Dougam Smitam, Lesteram Pigotas, Arts and Villiar Karson.
"It is something special," he said.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this was happening in New Delta as I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not Karalian Askota, but the ordinary day of Friday, together with 20 000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
The aptors and the Predilection are expected to receive applause and gazines after their victory.
Two of the husband has reached this record with a hurry Ričards Jonsons and the dead 20-year-old Championship Sers Anony Makow, who put a number of records in his career with more than 4 300.
Less Pigger, nine wins, won the victory of 4493 in their career.
It is one of the best fabric of our times, and it is no surprise that he has made progress that only the real one can achieve.
He is strong and strong, but his feelings of tactics are distinguished from other flies.
He is a fantastic race representative, his enthusiasm and charision attracts fans for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsoma, I said to his office that he would have fed 6 000 wins, if only the weekend and the big races were not shared.
However, to be serious, it is a real pleasure that the headquarters of the UK will be won for 30 years.
He is a living thread that is frightened up in the British race, and he is an excellent chamber.
The Designks noted this achievement through its firm mark, the flying leaf.
On the fining of wind speed up to the flying wet, the Latvian Depositor has been a British horses for twenty years.
This has been a full road of adventure.
He has won a number of large races, including the renovation of the 1996 "Eastal Seventh Researcher" in Askoit, with an aircraft accident and a disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character, challenging those who questioned him back in his best form.
And he could take the floor for some more time - the components in the past have said that they would be happy to continue participating at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putin is dismissed by the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unawaited the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been at Putin for many years.
The 63 year-old politician has been appointed a special representative on natural and transport issues.
The Kremlin states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the Head of Russian Administration's work," without mentioning the reason.
He was appointed by Antons Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 40-year-old Vaino has been a diplomat.
Waino was born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, the prestige of Moscow's National Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and then worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin's homepage in the Kremlin (Russian), he led him to the President's protocol and government staff.
After his appointment, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main job of the administration is to support your work as President of the State in drawing up the law and controlling the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his office and his job as a substitute.
Did she be smallegedly persuaded?
This step confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanovs is a snow and close to Vladimir Putin's allies and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service at the time of the KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
On a public television session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But, despite the smallest smallets, it is rare that such an explanation is persuaded, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is it the result of power for power?
Nobody knows.
However, the official statement that a man who was regarded as a presumed president would suddenly have liked to become a leader of the Russian environmental policy by a great scepticism.
"It is a fact that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust this complex position to me, a problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been working for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He has previously been a prime minister and a minister of defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the National Security Service of the KDK.
At the end of 1990, Putin was led by the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov was in his position as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanova in the number of five people who trust the most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanovs was considered to be a potential candidate for President of Russia, as Putin's reelection to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then it became President Putin another close of Putin - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became the prime minister and she came back three and a half years.
Loss of fish at an expensive cost in the city of Banfas
A husband from Banfas is asking for help to clarify the circumstances of the species appearing in the bank of his garden.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 of the fish could be sandwakers.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 meters from the sea, was released from a video webpage to Periscope, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimetres of the fish were found in his garden.
Kwine crossings: the bridge is now connected to the Faifa.
The €1.35 billion pound project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have joined the northern part of the crueline crueline and viaduke, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of a bridge is coming to a close.
The structure of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Today, the 1.35 billion pound project is to be completed in May 2017.
Keits Brauns was today back to the building site and was one of the first to build on the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of a Koferry bridge."
In this project, we are seeing an unworkable engineering solution, where only more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part.
Despite the vast majority of the bridge and the size of the bridge, the bridge and the viadrilled connection is an extremely delicate process that requires a huge level of precision.
In general, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the last stage that will connect the bridge with Rositu to be launched today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for recovery.
Maikl Martin, director of the fourth bridge project, said: "The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
For this fantastic project, the first link is a demonstration of the construction of a higher class of engineering.
After the last road phase and its connection with the aid of the northern tower, we were postponed to connecting the north of the road to a part of the ground, or viaduke.
This was done by a viaduke part of the north of 700 millimeters in the south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Milk, because viadukes are 222 metres long, weighs around 6 000 tonnes and had to pass on around 3%.
The snow, because the stick in both directions that worked with the team was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was done well.
Hundreds of Bails are acquiring gold for women.
There are tensions.
There is a dead alarm.
All of this is not worrying.
Dinamically leavers.
Without effort, exercise will be carried out on the beam.
Don't be able to the floor.
Absolutely not apologise.
And finally the Olympic championships.
On the other hand, 19 years of American exercise fought for a gold medal, in full showing the difference between itself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total of 62,198 was the head of a silver medal and her team's fun of the result of Alian Alia Mustaura.
On Thursday, MEPs will debate the outcome of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio at the end of 2016 at the July Olympic Games in Rio.
Bails became the fourth American contest of a multi-championship and the fifth best exercise, leaving the reputation of a better generation exercise and perhaps the best exercise in the history of the exercise.
When the final result was declared, she was dragling in tears, as the long road to that was over was over.
This is a breakthrough with unworkable athletes like Maikl Felps, who raised the form of sport at another level.
Bails has been dominated in his sporting event over the last three years, including 10 gold medals, as a combination of such an excellent, accurate and ambitious exercise that he called "the best exercise that she has ever seen" by the 1984 Olympic chamber.
In Brazil, they were expected to be the last test, where she had to deal with expectations of him rather than with other athletes.
She was disappointing if I returned to his home in Judgne, in the text without gold.
US sportspeople Simone Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane are taking the gold and the silver medal in the individual multi-fighting fighter for 2016 at the 2016 Olympic Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which was held on Thursday.
The first gold meal of Bails was won on Tuesday, rendering the award of a special selection coordinator, Martas Karolji.
Although Bailsa states that there has been no prospect of such expectations on his long road to wet beds, it is not true.
Parts of her predecessor, including her special acrobic shift, are accompanied by Latin music, which is frightened up in the streets of the Rio Olympics.
It is no coincidence.
The girl of her old age, when she was another madainis and was discovered by a trip on a sports zone of a third of the Burry Burmy mother, which took place on the Burmanie ternary, has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has lost a series of conjug-fighting races since the summer of the summer and a series of victory in a series of victories, as long as the Bails want it.
Although Mustaurg was a little under two rotation, it was just an illusion.
Co-weight and free movement - a part of the competitions where Bails will defend his champion is yet to come.
She came to the forefront with the outcome of 15.433 in the beam and strengthened the lead with the result of 15.933 in free movement
Rismane she was shot her mildly while they were waiting for results, which was only a formality and who fed her prey in the tears when the dream she had once had written in his remarks of his remarks was carried out.
The result of Raismine was a little reprisals over the four year old events when she shared the third place with Mustaura, but lost the fight for a bronze medal.
This year, the captain of the 22-year-old teamine called 'parental leave' came under a strong leadership.
According to the free movement that dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate to an aircradle effort.
Meanwhile, 19 years of the virus of Baillos, which she has published this week, has already played a completely different role.
The 6-year-old "bully cold" of the window is living in a shot in Filadelphia.
Police said that 6 years of ruin was shot in Filadelphia, pointing out that it was the second sixtieth in Filadelphia this week.
Children older in CBS Philadelphia confirmed that it is Mahai Brauns.
The parents are saying that Braille was fired several times, including the circus, the foot, seating and coaching, but was still in the consciousness when he was passed to the hospital.
His middny to the television of Deloendeza 'tells me:' His baby body was simply a bully cold '.
I could not believe that.
The boy has been in a critical situation in a hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family states that he will certainly recover.
He had to start to go first in the local primary school.
Braille is one of four people shot in the part of the town of Jammu.
Three men were also shot, two 29 year-old men and a 32 year-old man.
The CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29 year-old men is in a critical state, but the rest of the remaining two is stable.
It says that the child was found in the driving seat of the machinery, in a critical situation, next to 29 years.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether or not one of them was attacked.
The spokesman told the CBS Filadelphia that several shocks have been involved in firing.
There were some weapons of weapons that belong to a variety of weapons.
It seems that it has been a long-lasting firing.
Men were found on both sides of the pedestrians.
"So it seems that there have been a number of armed shocks that took part in the gun," Antonijs Gindivide, the captain of the Philadelphia police.
Many homes and cars have been damaged as well.
Nobody has yet been detained and it is reported that the police check records of the observators.
The love waged a six-year-old girl in his hand at the time of an appalling time, while she seemed his home in the town of Vestoukina.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still seeking to blame.
Why do we need Simone, Gabon and Lauria?
I call this the year for a number of reasons for the Women's Olympic Games.
Firstly, I have been to all the summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three miles, Simone Bails, Gabia Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, which inspires many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also has the Alija Raismane, which is the Jew and Medison Kociana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team is truly representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
The best exercise for the last four years is an American an American of origin.
Last year, Simone and Gabia took up sites 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
For the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Duglasa was surprisingly fleeing the Olympic chamber and the Americas could slip.
The world has now seen unbelievable exercises that have been met by triple World Championship Simone Bails, Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza for unprecedented but metesy exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American consecutive, who has gained a golden meal of individual many fight against women.
She won a silver medal from the team's fun Alija Raismane.
We have seen the best of this sport, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different in the course of the exercise.
Simona, Gabia and Lauria were also part of the Olympic Treasury, just like the Alliance and Medison.
They are the 'Olympic Pieter' because the next Olympic exercise team will have just four athletes and this is the last year of the third year of the third year of the work of the third country.
In fact, exercise is expensive in sport; in the first place, the restaurants are coaching with private easy clubs, and they are kept by parents who pay for exercises, facilities, trips, formasters, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenditure.
Most of these easy clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes run all their trainers, and this is a costly and long contribution to easy families.
Eimija Burio- Simone Baills and Megija Hainija - Laurian Hernandeza coaches have trained their athletes since the two girl started to deal with the light of light.
We must provide young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabia and Lauria, a cheaper exercise for exercises.
I established my own light organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is in Houleum, and we are offering more than 15 000 cities for young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercises or at low cost, we have also trained national and international championships.
In September, we will discover branches in Detroit in Detroit (my home city) to provide local young people with an opportunity to get to know this excellent form of sport.
Little develops the coordination of forces, channels and body, and also teaches hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to trail in milliness, and that is fantastic.
Dealing with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Alija, Gabia and Methonon for an excellent demonstration of the Means Force, with gold medals of the Olympic Games, and motivating countless young girls to become healthy, strong and successful to young women.
After the rejection of his or her offer, the new doctor intends to step up more strikes.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by agreeing to a change in the treaty with the British Medical Association, but rejected 58 per cent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hant announced plans to conclude the contract saying that the NHS is in a fragile state and that a further delay would only be to the detriment of workers and patients.
The first new outlets have already signed the new Treaty, which provides for a change in the conditions of night work for the change of night and the weekends to improve working conditions in non-standard hours.
Yesterday evening, the new doctors in BMA said that new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and it does not provide all doctors with equal conditions.
There have been eight weeks until the first newer of the new doctors sign up to the new Treaty, so progress must be made as there is not much left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem in the negotiations have faced the reluctance of the government to engage and sometimes with full silence.
This was in spite of the fact that, even last month, Mr Habremio said that his doors were always open.
It is a matter of urgency to take action, and to work with new doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
Over the last strike at the end of April, more than 13 000 rutan operations and 100 000 visits were postponed, while the nurses and advisers tried to replace doctors in the picycle.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreement by agreeing to a change in the treaty with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to increase the rate of working weekend to 54 000 new doctors, to which new contracts would be covered.
NHS Jose Mortimers called for new treatments not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything but only increase pressure on businers and worry, create stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been talking to the new doctor of doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about the draftsmen and the whistleblowers.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as staff deployment, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay inequalities in medical treatment, according to employers, England's health education institutions and the Ministry of Health, who are committed to reaching an agreement with BME in February and May.
Medicinal products for 2 mouts per day can reduce the risk of a condolent.
Thousands of patients who have been confused could treat medicinal products for 2 mouts a day, as the official representatives recomment to use them for more people and longer periods.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repetition for people with hearts.
These medicines are already prescribed for use within 12 months of the heart, reducing the risk of repetition.
The NICE remark of the NHS to use this preparation for 4 years after its heart in order to further reduce the risk of hearts for people with cardiovascular problems.
However, at present, NICE is currently in charge of using this preparation for 4 years after its heart to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular risks.
Each year, around 140 000 people in England are being confused and a quarter of them are in a repetible or insult.
Carriers and insults are causing fights of fitting fans with dams.
If the deceased hinges, it could produce thrombs by blocking the blood-stress-hill and intrineration.
Conversely, if thrombs fall out of the cardiovascular walls, it can go into the bloodshed and block blood access to brain drains, leading to infarktu.
People who have been hearted are exposed to a greater risk of repetition.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold with name in Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombs.
The new NICE guidelines published today are recommending people to use 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months, and 3 years from 60 mg twice a day with aspirine.
Professor Longson, Health Technology director of NICE, said: "Despite the fact that medicines are available for rehearts, more than a quarter of people who have been confeated are going through yet another kind of heart or insult, which often has serious consequences."
Fear of repeat hearts can have a negative effect on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelative or aspirine, combined with aspirine, effectively reduces the risk of repetition and infarn for people who have already experienced it.
Provisibly to put treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can expand the treatment for thousands of people that are thus the winner.
Given the limited information about the efficiency and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bloody contamination by more than three years, the draft guidelines do not comment on it for more than that date.
The culture of political correctness contributes to fraud during the election of Muslim communities
According to a management report, Mayor Lutfurs Rahman was dismissed from his post in relation to corruption.
The Government's report reveals that the cultural correctness culture has resulted in its eyes to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Pikl is criticising the police, electoral supervisors and the city council, that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process as "fear of ethnic and religious interests."
The former communist secretary, who has now become the head of anti-corruption organization, says that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so widespread that police should be allowed to pass the red lines to the election stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a document of identity of persons when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
Only the names and addresses of the votes are now on the votes cast.
He would even recommend that the votes of the voters who voted in their votes were given special tins in order to avoid a double vote.
They also need to provide more protection, says Sir's Build.
He considers that the press should ensure greater access to the Council's documents and decisions adopted by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from the cultural and anti-fraud culture that go hand in hand'.
The report was commissioned in Dauningstre following a scandal due to the holding of a town of erhamlete.
Last year, a special electoral court decided to remove the city's mayor of Lutfuru Rahmy from the city's corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahmans "cynically distorted the religious view of his Muslim community and silended its critics, accusing them of racism and islamphobia.
"Rahman has conducted his election campaign with the Guide that the religious duty of believers in the Muslim country is to vote for him."
Around 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.

Sir Milk suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a identity document to clarify the identity of the person.
His report says: "Evidence shows that vulnerable ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, are being forced to vote for the oldest selected candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is concern that the area institutions do not address these problems as a result of political correctness, since ethnic and religious interests could be touched."
There were 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to be used by votes cast in order to prevent 'chickens'.
The report, which is being examined in Ternesia, also called for a more thorough verification of registration in order to prevent the use of voters' lists of immigration and benefits fraud.

Sir Goodd strongly criticises the police in Metropoles, who did not understand that there were no accusations in the Bundelete case.
He tells us: "The court only dissatisfied the Lufturu Rahmy and his representative for actions relating to corruption and fraud."
He was well declared guilty after the standard of evidence of criminal law, based on uninterrupted evidence.
He also criticised the "kick-off" of the inefficient city council.
"The court's decision last year is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the homeland of the parliament, but the spread of worrying and hidden electoral fraud and the fact that fraud is not a threat to this good reputation.

Analysis of Bairona Makdonalda for a four-year-old of Ai Yanhas for a fourth source of 4x200 m freed for women, termed a storm from the viewer of the CBC.
The Canadian canal's CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators made comments that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race had "escaped from the race to the rive as a pig."
Bairone Macdonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when the 4x200 m free stave for women at the end of the finement set out his personal views.
Macdonalds, who were included in the team of the CBC commentators to give their comments alive, said: "It is impossible for a small fourteenth from China to keep up with it."
"You'll go too out, she was out of the rive that he was laughed and ended up as a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the second half of the 14-year-old Chinese pellender Ai Yanhana was 1: 57.79, a result of 1.61 seconds, which is the result of a cancel of the Teilores Rucks, allowing them to come to China.
The watchers throughout Canada reacted immediately on the internet because they were shocked to hear such tons and expressions.
Emets Makfarlains wrote on Twitter: "has the lively CBC commentator just said that the 14 year-old priest from China ended like a pigka???"?.
Idiously did not understand that they were still on the table.
Ai Yanha of the Chinese 4x200m phrase, was named women of a small fourteenemate from China.
Criticism against Baironu Macdonali rapidly took effect, as many demanded clarifications.
Users of Twitter were incapable of believing when I heard Bairona Macdonalda's insensitive comments.
Twitter: Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
A representative of CBC and Canada and Tevis have all lived like rables because of #oples.
After that, Scott Raárcel, who led the CBC's live broadcaster, apologised for the comments of Macdonalda saying: 'We apologise that the comment on the puzzling in the direct ether' was apologised.
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we very much regret that it happened.

My colleague, Scotland, had to apologise for his part.
Then the CBC spoke of an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comment of the Macdonalda.
The canal also published an apology and a statement quickly.
We very much regret that the following comments were made and they came into a direct ether.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologised to all viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairona's comments were made on the performance of the ash, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were, in any case, unprofessional and unsuccessful choices and the Bairone very regrettable.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonalds personally apologised to the person and tried to make it clear that he did not think his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
For the CBC Olympic Games, he said: 'I would like to take a moment and apologise for a comment yesterday, which I said yesterday after the free competition of women. "
I am talking about greening performance, not personally.
Needless to say, I had not thought of disrespect and I really am very sorry that this was the case.
The buyers are shocked by a woman who is shamelessly committed among submissions.
They were uncomfortable when the woman started to dress in order to allow bloggers in the middle of the shop.
To aggravate the situation, she wrote to her to see whether they stood and then shut down, forcing a bicks back on the shelf.
She continued to look for clothes of clothes in Bouverie Place on the sale of the Trade Centre in its shop.
The Bouverie Place of the trading centre in Folkeston was a place where the woman had a subveal and then put it back on the shelf.
Two children's mother Jenium Deividson was also present in the store, telling him that he was disappointing his clothes and left the shop after his subsister.
She points out that people were not able to believe their eyes.
She picked a boom in the middle of the game, picked off his kicycles and his bikes and kept them on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where they had to surprise, she simply owed it on the spot.
Everybody looked like his bloggers and apparently they did not like her, because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She picked three more bikes until it was judged that she did not like one of them to leave the shop.
It did not appear to worry her that somebody thinks or counts a man who bought the clothes that his clothes had.
Nowadays (33 years) from Kenya's story: "Derk's thinking that a person will buy the clothes that have been left for another man and who then have not been washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
"I accept that carrying out workers after her departure out of their shelves from performing shelves - which is also acceptable."
I could not imagine that a new subveal could be bought and would find that the other woman has been waiting for it and then they have not been washed.
The prime minister indicated that Primark was known as an incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August.
The clothes have been taken out of the shelves.
How to protect the firearms through Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dayymail.com could make it a little safer.
We have negotiated with Krav Maga's superoistol from New York in New York, in order to protect ourselves from the attachment of a gun with a firearm.
Whether you are attacked on the front or back of you, this video shows how to protect ourselves and take precedence over the attacker.
It makes sense that, if the attacker is attacked on the back, first it has to go back so that we can clearly see the vicinity and avoid shot trajectories.
The weapon then took off between his front hand and shoulder and kill the opt in the face of his free elaccount.
Then it follows the circus and the peak of the stairs, take him a weapon, take over his weapon and pulled over the weapon, continuing to draw her against him.
If the attacker comes from the front, the situation is similar, that this trajectory must be avoided, an weapon must be avoided, and that the worst cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and laughed into a shell and lastly depriving him of his weapon and rearing his or her continued image.
It sounds difficult?
There will be a video to see how the Mexodes are doing.
But remember, if you do not have a Krav Maga, then it is safer to bring his money to the robber.
The families of the candal are being put on the street by the family of Salta Cornvolas.
The family of canders has been thrown out of their place of residence as a neighbour of terror, causing damage to a social mother of 50 000 mdoctors.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Šone Trebilkok were left out of the property in Cornvola, as several complaints have been submitted to them.
When they were forcifully out of property, they found the property to be completely demolished.
It was a drastic gem in the buses and the walls, everywhere had the waste and the wall had been covered by the grafist.
The family is now out of property and is likely to live in private property.
Donna Makevoja, the manager of the Housing Service, said that there is a fear that housing will not be restored.
She tells us that people who were living here have been extremely difficult and she thinks they cannot live it.
In this case, a number of factors should be weighed, as in the future there will be no good repute in Kornevolus.
This family is a famous and their word is well known.
There were three sons in possession and police saying that their terror expressed their terror such as violence, street outside the street, intimidation of the local population, drug use, the sale of drugs and fine blebling and sistence.
In June 47, the old Skeldonate of whom the name was property is punishable by anti-social behaviour.
Most endemolised houses have been waste out of waste.
In the area where drugs have been marketed in advance, several slots of floors are also excited.
Neighbours say they have gone on to the street and were constantly called the police.
The Housing Service was forced by the Housing Service from coercion, when they had been given 11 weeks to collect them voluntarily.
The desperate neighbours were very happy because their lives had been absolute.
One said: 'They do not care other citizens'.
We lived them next 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It is unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
We could not sleep this morning.
We wished that there was so silly here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally away, it will be wonderful here.
Adami Fitzpair, who is the head of the Neighbourhood Protection Neighbourhood of Cornvolas, said that the family did not work with the local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police have been regularly called for here.
Differents of old and unusable articles were found in the adult deward.
He also said: 'It is a pity that the Irish did not show any sense of responsibility for their behaviour, because eating from the home is always the last step that the Housing Service of Cornvolas should be congratulated. "
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and neighbours had had to look very hard in their behaviour.
I appreciate the work done by all my team, Devton and Kornvolas police and combustion members, who were brave and collaborative with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make the lives of its neighbours easier and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpair said that the three son had lived here in different periods of time, but everybody was approximately 20 years old.
Inclean hake left in the room for one of the room after exodus.
Service workers will now have to shut off the wap of waste left in the mother.
In 2014, the police instructed a searches and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, weight, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
The Skeldone was only found guilty of storing a class B in the storage of drugs with a view to its dissemination.
She insisted that the money was intended to commemorate her son in Lie Šeldonam, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it has become known that they pressed a private property in the Plimates.
There were grafles on many of their homes.
The police tell us that they will continue to make tenants in breach of their own rental contracts.
The Lord of Devton and Cornvolas Andžela Krova points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who believe that they may behave like nice and have no consequence."
Criminal and anti-social behaviour are not acceptable to the police and the Kronite police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The cost of spending can trigger an impulse for the economy.

In Lucavisland, Cuba has begun a festival in Cuba.
On Sunday, 11 August, the night in Lucavisland, one of the last hears of this summer, was launched in Lucavsala, until Sunday night there will be Cuba.
For the first night of this evening, a British group such as Enter Shikari, who was awaited last year, did not disappear from the programme, an American panic of NOFX, DJ Maxim of the 'The Prodigy' and others.

President who remained in the shadow: Gustavam Low - 145.
On Friday 12 August, it marks 145 years since the second Latvian president Gustavich Earture was born.
The Latvian state proclaimed the Latvian state, but it remains unearned at the last of the first President of the Latvian President, Chakke and the first day of the first day of the former president of King Ulster.
None of our statesmen has so much championed democracy and the rule of law as a Earth in a book dedicated to Gustavam Gustavam, 10 years ago.
Delfi Annan argues that the Earth is one of the rare high positions of the politicians who have had a sense of humour.
Others are staggering, always very right.
He had not been given that, nowadays it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was a thing close to the people," he said.
Modern politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Kārli Ulme as good leaders, but rarely knows how unscrupulous him has been.
In government sittings, the only person to which he was missing was General White.
Even if he is a kind and smile in the bills, he was hysterical after nature.
"The earth with its sense of humour and democracy leaves exactly the opposite of the impression," said Auzz.
Professor Aivars Stranga, University of Latvia's University of Latvia and the philosophy of the philosophy of the University of Latvia, agrees with her assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and balanced country.
He also noted that the Lending had taken up with respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential pili.
"It was not an ordinary thing at the time, after the Earth Presidency, Albert King said the tradition took over," said the historian.
He was a quiet and weighed man who had long been to speak of President.
He did not aspire just after that.
He was also rather critically critical as he did not know the French language, but thought that it was absolutely necessary for the President.
"During the Presidency, the French bases have been taught," said Stranga.
The earth did not allow once again to stand as a candidate, he did not like his very high positions.
In all respects, he has a very dignified personality in Latvia's history, before entering the President of her serious office - he was a very demanding notary.
Also, the Earth led to the famous Low Suvorov street in 3, where the Latvian state was in practice during the government negotiations in practice.
He was always forwardly.
It was not a big MEP, but he did not understand the public.
"In the private negotiations, it has sometimes been said that it is not a symbol for him," said Stranga.
There was a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How do earth remember nowadays?
It is a shame, but a large part of him is associating with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, thought was centress.
"There was no big turmoil at his time: he could be associated with a true, stable presidency," he said.
There was also a Latvian national visit to Sweden from 1927 to 1930, which was indirectly meant by full recognition of a neighbouring country during the period from 1927 to 1930.
On 28 May 1929, the Earth arrived at a country visit in Stockholm.
The visit of the Swedish troops, Gustav V, took place in Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second of the Latvian state president was born in 1871, but went in life in January 1939.
Simply ways of helping the child to deal with the dush slowness.
I often have to encounter the fact that the infussy of a child, the appearance of a nation is regarded by parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows its anger, we do not know how to respond, Econet indicates psychoe Jekretire Kesa.
It encourages a small number of negotiations on these so natural and human feelings, the anger and niche that each is going through periodically.
Agresia, it is already a physical activity addressed to the people of others and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we, adults, are angry, are alarmed - we usually know what is going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can tell our anger and our nicks: express, oppress, hide, keep up, tell it to our friends or other loved ones; we can keep the silent drain, praise the cigarette (that is not the best way of dispel!), go a dozen and do other things that are usually not done.
We are neglecting our aggression against others, as we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are husceptible, do not understand what is happening to them as to how they can live.
They can say 'Ej away', 'Oh's foolish', 'Swaits mamma', 'I'll never see you,' and very rarely when you can say 'I dwisn't.'
Children are living in a literal sense, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneous and, indeed, their own feeling of expression, and are often present in various emotions.
It is very important that parents should not be prohibited in their feelings, including anger, without ashamed for this or not, but, on the contrary, to help the child.
Did the relationship be done?
A long working day, where everything has not gone as it would, or simply a bad mood, is so many reasons why I would like to go for a moment, day or even longer, from all over the world.
Can relations and some breathing a little over for a moment?
Or does it mean, however, that each partner country has its own way to go?
In my opinion, the gentlemen are divided into different ages.
Janis (23) is a concise and concise: 'In my view, if you need a passport, then you are not with the real man'.
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that can potentially help anyone.
If you feel that a partner starts to stay on the nerves for every small detail, then certainly - that is the right moment to study other hunting fields to understand whether or not she is missing, or not even if they want to see him or not.
So the answer is: yes, withholding can save time and understand how important you have a second half.
Kaspars (29) reveal its theory.
In my opinion, one from the other day in the relationship has to be taken up in the relationship, because, if you spend time with a man of 24 hours, seven days a week, then the controversy is inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I am doing every detail that the other is doing, and that is starting to fall on the nerves.
People are starting to stop each other, especially when they are not even more than talk, just about what you have done in the day.
My personal experience is giving it to mind, so I have not treated the relationship for longer than a couple of months.
If you think, at a while, that is better, then why is the woman that you are accompanied, who can think about the fact that it is not good enough and has a paradise place behind the mountains?
Dopting is already small.
If there is not, then it is not.
"I have to say that I'll be a little sentence for those who are not." said Edmunds (46).
That, 33, is a completely opposite view.
It seems to me that everyone needs a time for breathing.
You won't look each moment, all the time, from morning to night, to watch each other in the eye and defeat of the dreadful love.
I am sorry.
There are so many things: friends, work, white.
It has its own time.
Of course, friendship or wife, though, if they are to keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can survive to the edge of the caps.
It and only that way.
Mark (27) says: "It is hard to say whether or not, one can or should not take it, but one thing is clear: that is something that is lacking in the entire relationship."
If this question is raised, there will be some changes - the good or the bad side - in the near future, depending on ourselves.
I think that while there is a new and a travest, I think that there is still a lot of time, but when everything remains serious and that relations go to a completely different phase, there can be no talk of rest.
You decide to spend all the lives together!
"If you do not have a single company now and every time there is a breathing, then that will be when you are pensioners who have to comment on how they need to be better known over the day," said Kristaps (19).
All the names have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozental was a first waker of the lator's interest in the fathers of the arts.

National Environmental Service leader Inga Kolegow has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Directorate General of the State Revenue Service (Revenue Service), LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that her candidacy has multiplied between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for discussion are linked to the politicians' visible but more frequent interests, and they have nothing to do with my assessment of professional abilities.
"That too is unacceptable to me," he said.
If her nomination was approved in the government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the VID to be changed to the fullest, with all the support of the government.
Without it, there would be no full work, concluded Kolegova.
"Sometimes I have publicly emphasised that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now the whole of my candidacy is excessively politicised," he said.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown for me, it is a experience that I appreciate as a benefit," in the case of a Reiznie-Ozoos Kolegova.
On Wednesday evening, Koleegorod highlighted "significant contradictions" between the nominee's explanations and the information available in the public register on the cost of dividends of the SIA Pallogs, as the public authorities' decisions in the meetings of the members of the meeting give a profit.

The Riga voluntary has introduced all recommendations made by the GCC with regard to the Russian project.
The Riga Free Port Administration has introduced all of a total of five recommendations from the National Control (VC) for the deployment of the infrastructure project in the island of Russia for the transfer of port activities from the city centre and Ghn.lv in the company.
The approval of the project is scheduled for the nearest free port board.
For recommendations to be introduced in line with the GCC, preparing the necessary documentation for implementing recommendations, Riga Free Port Management was also followed by the conclusions of the legal and operational audits carried out by the international audience of Deloitte Riga in the future phase of the project.
Information on implementation of recommendations has also been sent today to the GK.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Port Administration does not agree with the opinion of the VC on the usefulness of implementing the Russian project, we have a very responsible approach to the project's implementation and the provider of the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction works planned within the project are fully completed within the prescribed deadlines and the planned amounts.
"In order to prove all the projects involved in the project, including the EC, VC and also the stimulation of the project's main objective to successfully implement the project, we have fully introduced all the recommendations made by the KK with regard to project management and supervision issues," notes the head of the Russian island project, Sanita Caire.
The long-term plan of action to control and monitoring the achievement of the project has been accompanied by the essential planned activities of the parties involved and the timetable of the necessary decisions, definitions of the meetings and the regular reporting and their deadlines for the planning of the planned construction process, as well as the key definition of border points.
The agreed action plan to reach the project target of 31 December 2018, followed by the recommendations of the VC, is supplemented by performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the duration of the activities of other parties involved in the project from the Rabinet Member States.
A project management plan for the development of project management and the mitigation of the potential risks has a new design of the project management portfolio and the documents developed by which it provides a monitoring and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
The project's management structure, which reflects the structure of the project's management team, the qualifications and functions of the project, has been developed.
The project's Stakeholder Communication, which, in addition to the parties set out in the project's action plan, is designed to improve the successful completion of Riga's project, define the project's successful completion, the principles, types and periodicities of the information exchange.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, it will be necessary to justify in future the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the initiation of procurement and the rule of law.
As part of the project, port infrastructure on the Russian island has been built: four new deep-water stories, rail adds and engineering communication.

German researchers have been discussing "the number of victims of the Berlin Wall."
According to a new study, the number of fatalities under the Communist feeling could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data passed on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, at the border with the western allies zone of 1945 to 1989 and the subsequent communist authorities killed 1841 people trying to break out of their territory.
The museum of border-related deaths has been studied for years, and has been corrected by the number of victims of death.
Another 11 deaths have been added to the list later this year, including a six-year-old boys, which drowned by trying to become West in West, through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deservers.
"The ultimate amount of damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said the director of Museum Hildebrante.
"Our task is to make sure that the caps of those who died in an attempt to escape from a communist country would be kept and disappeared," said the statement of the German Hill.
However, other researchers have already called on the figures.
"The number of 1841 is unconvincing," Süddeutsche Zeitung said, according to the Berlin Free University of East Germany, Johens Schtatate.
He, along with the other researchers of the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing alleged suspicious deaths at the border, and until now only 260 cases have been possible.
In the past, researchers were expected to murdered 138 people only on the fall of the communists in Berlin.
In view of those people who died trying to flee into the Baltic Sea or to become in the West through neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the various types of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all the suicides of East German border guards, whether directly linked to their services.
The museum also lists deaths that are not linked to direct violence.
"If the anciens aged between 70 and 80 died from a heart of border control, they must have the consequences of this' murderous border," he said.
However, it is convinced that a distinction should be made between the old people, who may have died as a result of the handling of their experience and those who have been caused by prolonged waiting at the border at the border at the border.
Irrespective of the number of victims, there is no easy list of victims, as the Communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and researchers must have documents in different archives in their archives.
However, the Shadow Group has recently passed new documents and that is why it could come up with a new number of victims in the near future.
LPF president Pone to Rio with the accreditation of a coacher; that is a surprise.
In the last few days, the win of the Latvian Olympic Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Rioduty, came into the Olympic Games with his accreditation, but I feel surprised at that.
On Wednesday, there was a broad gunge following the inauguration of the Olympic skeer in Germans Jakubovska, who found that the last-minute visit to go to Pone, while the trace lasted at home.
Bavarian Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins were approved for the initial list of drivers, coaches Jakubovskis and Deivs Kolink, as well as president Pone of the federation.
There were five participants at the Olympic Games in Latvia, and before his departure, Aldon Vrublevskis said that Germans would have to search for tickets.
"However, apparently, he was not," Pone said, saying that he did not influence the outcome of Ribakova.
At the request of the federation, Uvja coach took her help.
Pone, who is a member of the CEO's executive committee, strongly criticised the performance of LOK, leading to the guilt of the organisation of overseeing the Olympic sport.
In my view, it is unethical in the Executive Committee of LOC to endorse five persons and not replace them.
"I don't know why exactly the Pelling Federation did not have any place," Pone said that the Society did not assess the work of the federations and their presidents, recalling that the federations' presidents do not receive their wages.
The Pone also criticized Jakubovski, who said that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not confirmed among the participants, he referred to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
The Pone could not tell us why he was in the Olympic Games with his accreditation, which was probably due to Jakubovsky.
"I was submitted as President of a federation (" team leader "), but for unknown reasons, I received the accreditation of a coacher and now nowhere does not go in."
The situation changed every day, the number of accredited accusations changed.
I think it will be Germans until the last point, because there were no other information.
She told LETA that she had had a conversation with the Plons and after the start of the Nibakova Start, but the LPF himself said it was an ordinary conversation with the desire to throw the athletes before the start.
The LPF recalled that the LPF is overseeing five types of sports that are in the Olympic programme, and four of them also have training children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation also said that grading issues were also very important in Latvia, but also for programmes such as such programmes he had been speaking for almost two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that the World Cup in Latvia could be resolved in 2018.
The trace in Rio is not my leave, I am working, I spent my time and I am trying to realise the four years of the programme.

This year, more than 600 000 juvenile layers and juveniles will be screened in the Daugava floor.
For the second year, the juveniles of fish have been earmarked for the removal of the fat.
Today there are 25 000 lax juveniles with an average weight of 31,3 grams.
Each year, the marketing and numerical strength of scientifically substantiated species in the Daugava and its river basin is given to the juvenile of juvenile and wet species.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava and its waterborne waterborne bodies is carried out by Bior to the legislative acts on the basis of an expert on the loss of fish resources and a conclusion of what countervailing measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
The National Environmental Service, on the basis of that expertise, shall decide on the extent and type of compensation.
The annual refunds for the recovery programme of Latvia are EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvia's energeous fish spawning ligzle in the fifth year was the fifth year of Kazibalas and Panel.

The deployment of olematic spawning newdocks in water is an important measure that contributes to the protection and propagation of fish resources in Daugae.

The French court rejects the requirement to confuse the shops in the refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request by the French authorities to mix tens of self-produced shops and restaurants in the camp where several thousand refugees live.
This week's sitting in Calais said that the country had to dismantle 72 Self-established stores where people sold in the camps, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, are offering a frcheese service, a rate of 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some of the euro in restaurants.
Calais's prefect office pointed out that these self-established companies have to be mixed because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, and also cause fires and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group have explained to the Court that these small businesses are fundamental because the food provided by governments and support groups does not guarantee the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to rise.
They also pointed out that the self-imposed stores and restaurants often offer free shelters and ears to those most in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have set up 72 self-established stores, but it understands the prefect worries of Calais.
Judge of the Alliance in Francoa Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply provide food for people who live in 'extremely uncertain conditions'.
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.

Britain gets silver from 7 to 7 series in the fight when Fiji's country fed the gold hungry.
The impressive performance of Britain's random ranks at a regroa-7 series came to an end on Thursday when the Rio Fiji country hit them with the result in 43: 7.
Fiji demonstrated the daughter in the bombing of the bomb, the bomb is playing with its feet, supports the game and the brutal game of the gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The message of contest was the silver meal of the silver medal, which was a third medal in Britain, and the British Selection can be proud of its success in the first Olympic regeneration of 7, where they did New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the era of the tsunami, a Bote team failed to defeat with the outcome of 7: 5 days in the second of Britain.
But, in any case, Fiji is currently in his best form in order to win the 15 husband.
Although little is likely, however, a certain calm for Britain could be the fact that at least one of the children won a gold meal, and that is the former coach of the Fiji random coach, the former coach of England from Vimdendton.
For Britain it was a fascinating adventure.
Eight years ago, under the head of Raw, they lost all games in a regroa-7 series in Adenegation.
This time they lost just one game.
It is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji had an impressive opening of matches, revitalising the British force of force.
For Kapteinim Tomam MiFID and members, this was the result of a breakthrough with a number of coaches and the World Cup Championships, with 5: 0, when Osea Colinisau won the first birth.
In the last four minutes, Jerium Tuwai was further increasing the weights in the right wing.
The result of the 12: 0 and British team did not even really touch the bomb.
Mičela's excellent force did not allow his Leoni Nakaravam to have three points, but this only had a little effect on Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua won the bonus in the right corner by strengthening Britain to 17: 0.
After the rest of the game, Nakarava was further increased and until the end had more than a minute of the end of the first half of...
The majority of the dooming doses of the British force were evaded and crossed the line from some of the setbacks of the British force.
The land was set out in 29: 0.
Fiji was born to play rheat-7 matches, as long as the British are still taught.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team did a fundamental change at midst by breaking up four minutes after the first half of standards, which was good after the first half of the time, until after a fantastic team of fantastic tears, there were a few more points for the Fiji team.
Denam Nortonam has succeeded in getting points to the British team in the left corner with 36: 7, but the game was lost, while the South Sea salt fans were scared and decked in the tribings.
There can be no admiration of the thoughtful attitude of Fiji.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's win even freer with another bonus at the end of the game.
Fiji could start to celebrate at the end of the game, but the British broke after the defeat was able to sit in the room.
In the first half of the day, Fiji took Japan with the result of 20: 5, while the British broke over South Africa, where the two teams were in a very tight fight against the bonus and the southern hairraces lost only a few points.
In the first half of the day, Kail Brown was nominated by a Bok team, while at the second half, Dens Northony crossed the line and moved the bomb between the masts and giving the British a brighter.
Markans Watson, who is Anthona's top 15 team player, was at the end of the game with a victory and another silver medal.
The fight against cancer was inspired by the Standing of Helena Glover and Heteri.
It will be the most emotional mess of a gold in these races, and it is already a great deal.
Between the first and the last of the storm, the Helena Glover and Heteres Standing Street's dead were of particular importance in the trail of Estacio Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they spent Robin Vilnius's mindware, which inspired her to be the first women of cooted in coosing women into British sports history, which has been successful in the history of British sports.
They were unquestionably dominated by an unprecedented, unprecedented victory for them.
The two great athletes with the sleepy eleganci drove on the surface of the water are not fully reflecting the triumpha.
Ahead of each of the gold in gold, there is a whole team that works hard to keep athletes constantly improving their performance and the biggest contribution to their success was given by the coach, who was even kidnapped for 30 months, to kill this day because of his cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it emerged.
I had a cancer of urry, one of those that can and has been carried out.
If it did not, it would spread the whole body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It slightly replaces your vision.
Cancer cancer was launched in December 2013.
The trio ordered the train to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intermediate season and to reduce the length of the break to a minimum, if so.
I needed income, which is why I was quick to recover.
It stimulated recovery.
I was at a hospital and I went to 6, 10 and even 15 meters of distance, although the doctor said that some steps would have been enough.
All this began.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even higher.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Vilnius, who was very worried about the whole morning and spoke out more than usual.
Standing from the Karalian Artillery Unit in Afghanistan said: "This was a painful week, but that means a great deal for me."
It just confirms how much it means, and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years of the Helena and Robin has been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better trainer or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Hetere's Standing of Standing has lost in a few years under Standing.
The boat is reaching such a huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the tears from New Zealand and Denmark started to come closer, the overweight of Standing and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helena kicks: "Pressure is keeping ride."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we had no high hopes.
On that day we had no intention of gazing the records, but simply to obey and win the race and that is what we did.
A couple of years will go on to decide what to do next.
Next month there will be a search engine for Glover and TV, Stsive Bashala.
For the time being, she simply wants to reap the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last point of competition.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I am the Olympic championship.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This was about four minutes this time.
She said it is fantastic.
A unique opportunity to look at the fantastic architecture of the Central Biblic building.
King more than the city of Central Bibliotic, as members of the historians of South california in Architecture are meeting with the authors of Art Schwari and Architecture history in Art Schwarh and Architecture History.

The tickets are to be purchased in advance; by SAH / SCC members $15; other $25.
Mixed and omulous DTI bars are going through domestic change,
To mark the 90th anniversary of the Lhasandaugo Central Biblistock - what other than a new book!
He will go down to the last with the head of the Treasury. "
According to him, the Prime Minister of the Alliance of Greens and Farmers and the Finance Minister, Danai Reizniece, Ozoase (Greens / Farmers Union) are already 'principally important' to confirm the nominees of the Finance Minister Kolegova.
Rajevskis estimates that both Kuchinskim and Reiznie-Ozos in the government are the "first big decision" that might affect him as a politician's future.
If it is now beginning to change its position in the selection of the driver's candidate, this will have a negative impact on their imidge in the public administration.
The session of the Cabinet of Ministers on the agenda for next week's sitting is the question of the transfer of VVD leader Kolegow at the office of Director General of the Revenue Service, according to the government's agenda.
Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola, driven by Kolegova, has been pushed for by Inar Petersson from the service of the service, and when the post of Director of Director-General of the Revenue Service ended without the result.
She said that she would be able to stand as a driving seat in an interview with Dace Pelite, Head of the Revenue Service's Dace Pelite, on Thursday 11 August.
The Minister for Finance subsequently recognised that the other nominees of the VID were not being considered for the time being.
The National Association's Saeima group, Raivis Dzintars, also admitted that NA is increasingly in favour of Kolegova VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit threatens the inability to set up a government.
On 12 July a month ago, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal have failed to take sufficient steps to reduce the deficit to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
Calculations show that, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal had a deficit of 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5. 1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while laying down fiscal targets for the nearest possible times.
One of the reasons why the EC, however, did not introduce sanctions against these two countries is growing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Such adverse sentiments would only increase such adverse sentiments.
Critics also point out that the EC has no consistency in its decisions from the beginning of agreement on uniform rules and then failed to apply them in practice.
For example, the German Bundesbank President Jenos Veidmann pointed out that Europe is losing trust in such a way, giving the citizen the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendations and not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved the extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit by the end of this year to Portugal and until 2018 in Spain.
The European Commission promises to check the progress made by both countries over the next few months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal have to be ready to introduce additional savings if circumstances are required.
Initial forecasts indicate that Portugal could reach the target set in due time and could decrease its budget deficit to 2. 5% of gross domestic product already this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Agenda, the government of that country should implement austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional emphasis on control of the procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4. 6% this year to 3. 1% next year and 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures must be 0. 5% of GDP every year in the next two years.
Particularly complex achievement of these objectives makes the fact that the Spanish political parties have failed to reach an agreement on the formation of the government for eight months, and the possibility of Spain to hold early parliamentary elections for a third time in a year is becoming increasingly important.
However, opinion polls indicate that the third elections in the country of political landscape would not change substantially.
The Popular Party continues to be the current Prime Minister, Mariann Rahoja, who would once again have less than 33% of the votes.
The popularity of my popularity is slightly higher than the socialists, while the popularity of the anti-Semitic party in Podemos, or 'Citizens', is a slight decline.
The People's Party wants to have a Socialist and 'Ciudadanos' engagement in the government even this month, otherwise it will not be adopted by mid-October, and submitted to the European Commission for approval of the draft budget for 2017.
Rafaels Hernando, a representative of the People's Party's Party, said that if the government was to be hosted and the parliamentary elections will be held for a third time, however, Spain will become a laughing of the whole of Europe.
The purity of smoothes in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
With the fifth year of monitoring beaches, activists have concluded that there is an increase in the number of waste generated each year, and there are mostly bathing visitors.
The most polluted sites are in Riga.
It is very difficult, in the opinion of the Capital of Athens, that the bathing areas are copied every day and that they are being combated with uncompromised visitors.
In addition, the wasted waste over the rainfall can be recorded in the water, so much to damage its quality.
Apart from Liepaste beaches and certain places in Kurdish, the purity of beaches is critical elsewhere in Latvia.
This kind of statement was released this week by the volunteer of the 'My Sea' campaign.
On the fifth year of its thoughts along the Gulf of Riga, activists have concluded that the number of non-resident waste has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year its criticism of the issue has entered into.
"We see this year as the number of waste to beach 100 meters may even exceed 200 units," said Jensis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio has been visiting, he came to the beaches, where the volunteer's march along the Gulf of Riga went along.
This year, the various municipal waste and laydock activists had to harvest even the light bulbs left behind in the sand.
Ulme teic, the participant and the organiser of the pedestrip and organiser Ulme teic, are the people who are guilty of pollution.
"The most important source is beach visitors, with more than half of the total number of waste there is plastic, different waste, from bags, plastic pieces that are already depleting, can no longer be identified and smokers, bottles, corks," said Ulme.
There is also a bathing water among the nearst beaches.
For example, in Daugasin, almost 800 waste units have been collected on average per hundred metres.
The organisers of the campaign also explained that they had a warning or ban on smoking every day.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing areas - Daugavity, Yesterday and the Agedogs - are, unfortunately, coming large and far beyond the desired or 135 target of reducing the number of waste units to 135 units," concludes the environment.
The cleansing of sites every day, in the summer of the heated days, even twice, is explained by the spokesperson, Ugenis Vidauskis.
The fight against unsafe visitors is, however, very difficult.
We come back to these people's cultural issue.
"Those who mention use alcohol, smoke and do all of the things that cannot, even special marks, do not work," said Mediumauskis.
On the other hand, calls on bathing sites to report polluters to the police.
The police can be called on, to point out these abuses and to combat all of them.
Perhaps there may be any new warnings, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will change the situation radically.
"All together should simply go and be intolerable to such offenders," he said.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have already been carried out by a Health inspector this summer, which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, as for other years, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The situation now is that, in all 56 bathing areas, the quality of water has been good for the whole period and there is no need for greening.
"We'll take the last of the analysis at the end of August," said Normunds Kadibrick, the senior expert in the field of environmental health.
In the period of heavy rainfall, landfill waste may be wasted on water.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, be presented to an environmental professional.
Rotation in the Russian elites continues: a change of leader of Putin's administration.
A set of posts?
Vladimir Putin said that Sergei Ivanovs had left the post of his office and will continue to be the Special Representative of the president for Nature Protection, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin told Ivanovich in front of the change: "Dear Sergej Borisvič, we have been working together with you for many years and do so successfully."
I am pleased with the way in which you have fulfilled your duties.
I remember very well of our agreement not to use you as President of this President for more than four years.
That is why I am aware of your desire to change the scope of the operation.
And I hope that you, too, will make full use of your expertise and experience in your new role.
However, it is pointed out that the leadership of the President's administration is a very important position and made Ivanova one of the most influential people in the country.
Bearing in mind that in Russia next month elections are expected to take place in the Duma elections, it was a rumours that this step was linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elites.
Ivanov was also called a member of Putina's head office, so the statement that he himself wanted to take office as President of Nature and Transport was questioned.
According to the Lit.en archives, Ivanovs is a Director-General of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been the snow and will close the ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his meat in a spectacle in 1975 where Putin was known.
Later, he became the Federal Security Service leader, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first President of Russia, Boris Yalcina, was appointed to the Russian Security Council Secretary at the end of the killing of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000a the Ivanova article was confirmed by the "Information Security Doctrine" in 2003, which included the revitalisation of the state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2003, Sergei Ivanovs became the Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, but already in 2005, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mikhail Fradar, and was responsible for the development of company companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the President's administration, Ivanov will also remain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the European Union.
The scenes come from the elites of the family Soviet party.
President Vaino had the same post as Ivanovs.
We have long known Mr Eduardovians.
Another of the times when you were under management in the government.
And for the last almost five years, we have been in practice every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, after all professional and personal qualities, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The writer comes from a family belonging to the Soviet-party elite.
His grandfather Karls has held high posts in the Estonian Communist Party, including the ten year up to the year 1988 as its first secretary.
"Meduza" with reference to Estonia's self-determination and independence "describes that, at the end of 80- year, Karls Waino had asked Moscow to permission force against the demonstrators.
However, he had refused and lost his office soon.
In a nutshell afterwards, the Germans have moved to live on Moscow.
Antons Waino has both solated Moscow's International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the President of the Presidency.
It has already been said that the last few children in Russia have been shaken by the exhibition and even arrests of a number of high-ranking officials, including the replacement of the governors and the federal representatives of several regions.
According to polyitologists, President Vladimir Putin replaces the elite before the next elections in 2018.
One of the main features of this is the presence of the force of force bodies, which are more and more frequent.
Ladies and gentlemen, niciforenko is losing the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the first step in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighting for his participation in the Olympic Games took place in the area of 17.
There was a very little hope for the Latvian Television in the Latvian Television, who had a very little hope and that was clear before the competition.
He also said that the judo shot was trapped in his struggle.
It is fitting that, in order to deal with the Olympic signs, Newsiforenko had to be used in a different weight category than was added, namely by weight to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan was a harder of 25 kilograms.
It has already been said that Jevgeny Borodavko has been fighting by a weight of up to 100 kilograms against Rjunodoki for a half minutes until the opponents of the opponent win the mess.
Latvia has concluded the start of a race to the Rio rig.
They will disappear in the Rio Tills.
The following was preceded by the report by the Drivei Jevgevijs Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more tight opponents in front of him, but more ambitious can sometimes come as a surprise.
He did not get.
The task of Arti Newsforenko was even more complicated as the experience of less and opponement of respect was also respected.
A similar one, somehow, he had a half minutes for a half minutes longer than Mr Borodavko.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of ambition in recent years in the judians of Latvia.
Gunars CHirson passed on the side of the federation's side and his financial star had his financial star Vladimir Sheepisov from Latvia, the Golden Score of Latvia, went on to the Golden Score.
Jacovich, who is here consciously of Kazakhstan, and the Vsevolg Zoleum, are not seeing heirs.
But if you do not grow it will not be.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, as from another gallery, the Riga Panorama launched a promise of the president of the Latvian Federation of Judo to deal with the medals.
Flight from reality.
In the evening it was an impatience and a cause for concern that the beaches' Samoilovs / Schmodichi of Evancane / Pecie Solbergs were waiting for concern.
"It's just about the loss of life," he said.
The Latvian duce was a small derogation - it could have been lost, but not more than four points in two sements.
The stimulation of the previous match was still growing.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling is above the corner of a corner in the length of the game.
The wind storm of the game created additional complications.
It seemed to be the case that it could be ours - which is more comprehensive - an allies.
But it did not become.
The Latvian duce was just as simple as it was.
Dowadaded to Samoilova and waiting when he will plunk.
There was a burst against Cuba, at the end of the first season and the third beginning, because the load was not over a joke.
It could have looked at it at the time, as little was done, but when it was, it was done honestly.
Samoilov, Samoilov, won two sements with Shell as the first took over from 16: 15, but also 16 left, with the loss of a lost point.
But it could also be lost to 0: 2, because the second season deficit was -4, but also, thanks to the storm, we managed to win.
The third had already been a flight of Evancane.
The wall of the chain - unconvincing, the second mood is often too close to the network and Samoilovam lasted very little for a fruitful attack.
If there was a kind of alien Samoilovs, then he was more successful this time, and only the loss would be unprofessional.
The Kremlin was also mistaken and it is symbolic of him that the bumphere of the last bombs came out directly by him.
It was a little room for a team.
There was also a lack of luck: in the third place alone, two of the attacks were almost completely out of the corner, but the ball was still close to the line.
Two eels were beside the line.
The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
In the first two games, Evancane was tortured with Serbs, then it was very productive.
It was all together lost to the taboo.
The reasons for failure must now be resolved peacefully.
Maybe it could have been like many of the stadiums, rather than with the delegation of delegations at the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours back.
Maybe a little self-persuasion gave a semi-halfend series.
Maybe the Kgenders did not have to play, but sooner to come here and to be better accustomed.
Maybe it was a mistake to locate the athletic form.
So far more than the question of answers.
Our bloggers are at the end of the game.
The meal over the medals ended.
What next?
Some of the World Cup and the Jurmala Master also remain.
A mistry with Samoilova has never been friends and will not be so, because there are too different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When there is a dream of Olympic medals, there may also be a divorce, because blame will be sought not only in the sixth, but also in the partnership.
It is not difficult but it is much more difficult to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
The two brothers play a bar, but the Janis with Tomu has already tried, and also herself, and Mikil Samoilovs is still too green to start fighting the world's headlines.
You can try to go to Haralin's Registry, Alexander Soveel, Edgar Tours, to come back to the Phyman Van den, but it will not be better than that of the World Cup at the time of the World Cup.
The sands sands for them this time they were not massacred.
And everything.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that the beaching beer is becoming more popular, new above over and only the rare growth is less than two metres.
This is not yet a guarantee of success, but an essential argument in the fight for victory.
There is no longer any more.
Both the athletes and journalists have the chance to stand in the vendor of the games, as well as choosing their own.
The US basketball service is living on a cruise boat, a part of the tennis doesn't go into the Olympic village.
Also, a share of the beaches' voyleum has been found in a hotel in Koduaba.
This time, much modest burdens were required for journalists to have been heavily exaggerated.
That is why the choice went back to hardware.
The risk is because they can sometimes be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justifiable.
In combination with the renuncius of Vladimir of Vladimir, the boundaries on the boundaries of Koduaban and Iteema.
A flat of 200 metres away, a bishoden arch at midhour.
Rajons's grassland is safe because the faveal pave, but the vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimír iron is not what can be said straight away, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov was not.
In the case of Mrs S., there was a dream of another medal dream in the morning of Friday morning.
At 100 meters for barriers and lumping, Laura Ikauniece-Admidls restayed from his personal record.
But there are already five disciplines.
After 10 years, Porgijs and Besa shot in Liepaja.
In 1973 the Latvian National Operate was the portray of Porgijs and Besa.
Since then, the internationally accepted tag has not been restored.
That is why the organisers of the Arts of the Arts of Arts and the Liepaja artistic forum have decided, in close cooperation, to give the audience the opportunity to empower George Gusshvili.
"It is a great pleasure for us that after a decade, when Liepaja was likely to enjoy a study, this excellent piece of the concertation of Porgijs and Beslan has been presented to us in a new, new concert" Big engine, "said Baiba Bože.
"Porzinc and Besa" is a splendid story of love, volatility, passion and life tragedies and simple, day-to-day events.
The vitality, the music and the rites of the afrost are reflected in it.
That is precisely the lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this loread is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and indeed deep," says Sairo.
What I love the most - listening to or opening up the operation - always has the subsistence points - the famous lies, the famous motive, but these transition from one nature to another, to the light of one private or another, or cord or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, the construction," the musical Head of Operation Porgijs and Besa, Andris Poga.
There is a consensus among Operators that this is a grand event.
They are very pleased that I will hear the famous Turnovina operation in the world.
It is regrettable that Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
"Profit professional," said Edgars Needs.
The concertation was dedicated to the first ever orchestra of orchestra in the new concert hire orchestra and, for the first time, the concertation of the operation.
The thoughts of the renovated buildings of the Art Museum could be named on behalf of Jaaken Rozental.
Riga viciner, Andris America's Anyzental exhibition, said the same address could not in the future come from Valdemar's Holland Valdemar's street, but Jaaken Rozenthane Square 1.
Mar Lorce, who is the director of the Muzan, said that the re-registration of the address would result in a very tight bureaucratic burden, but generally welcomed the idea and therefore agreed to the municipality's proposal.
The City of Riga has been steered to this idea in 1936 by establishing the Burden Rozentar, Burim Rozenane, which is on the museum.
The then museum director, Vilhell Purman, was one of the initiators of this monument.
This way of operation could thus be purely logical.
It is a little bad for me all the time, but the Vilheim Purman, where we will give his name?!
"But if you, Mr America, promise you to think..." said Lorce.
It is estimated that the National Art Museum Building, after an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation, officially opened its doors this year in May.
This week will at last launch the reconstruction of the VEF culture.
Around €11 million will be updated for the "Welve" SIA.
It is planned to renovate several Castle facilities, including two viewers, as well as to accommodate people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract a European Union fund worth €6 million, while Oleg Bush Director Oleg Buchov said that there is still a complete lack of clarity to the project on European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to launch the ERF's culture pilibrium in attracting the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months, a real response from the officials in the Ministry of Finance, the money allocated to it or not," says Buchrov.
Last December we told us that everything was dependent on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission that take the decision itself that Brussels is not taking a decision.
Now, we are seeing that another round of discussion is emerging, and we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council will no doubt guarantee that this process will be launched and completed within the deadlines," he said.
As reported, more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Castle collective took the concert ahead of the renovation of the buildings immediately ahead.
While the year passed, the renovation of the building has still not started and were collectively continued to work under unsuitable conditions.
The VEF Castle of Culture has been divided into seemingly independent restructuring works in the VEF Conversion Department of Riga City Council, where each will ensure a different implementation of the Castle's functions.
The first is to increase access to the VEF culture of culture and to the repair of the surrounding area.
It aims to clean up surroundings and engineering and reconstruct the building of the building.
Second: improving the supply of ERF Cultural Castle services.
It envisages improving the quality of the building, the wall and the restaurants of the building, the stage of the study and sound record studies and the building of internal engineering of buildings.
Third: improving the working conditions of Creader amateur, which includes plans to improve works equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 'Lives', a legenary seemaker can be found out in Liepaja.
Differences of "Lorly" characteristic articles are to be looked at in order to reflect the activities of the group from the beginning to 2010, when it is notified of the end of the group.
There will also be scores of participants, music tools, awards and concertation, as well as other unseen things for the wider public, reflecting the creative activities of the group's Lobi group.
The exhibition will be supplemented by Liepaja Museum's objects.
The visual location of the exhibition is tasked in cooperation with fashion artist and glezist Elite Patmalian.
Also musicians who have been associated with the Lobi and their relatives referred to the invitation and shared both the subjects and memory.
The first leases to be launched in 1970, when a new ansamblil led by Juris Pavtol was created in the culture of Liepaja culture.
It also calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that all Member States have access to information in the event of an accident.
In 1971, there was a fate of destiny when Juris Pavtol took note of a group of Kuckevich and Metalurpe's culture pill, calling for an Ingrid of Ingrid, Andri Kruman and Jens Groda.
Over the years, the group's composition has been held for not once.
Participants have joined, others have gone, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to show that Latvian rocophile was able to live and exist remains unchanged.
"What we're not missing is that the boys, the mataines and the beardants, these boys disproportionately discovered the universally accepted retrootype," he said.
The group, without the previous musicians, was treated by excellent music as Igo, Vilnis Kriek, Valdis Šarks, Laimis Rated, Aivars Virga, Aivars Brities, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
The entry shall be released free of charge.

Greater time and the truth for the top.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of the Latvian Catholic Church of the Latvian Catholic Church of the Latvian Catholic Church, Jinkevich, Jinkevich, said in an interview in an interview with the independent of his group.
Because the strength of the truth is higher than the fault of the evil.
Many of them are on the road to the sacred hostile of the Maria's skies in Aglona.
What kind of stories will the believers get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main dieval in Aglona has been set out by the nuntium of Pope.
Therefore, the content of the main message is in his hands.
It is also a kind of tradition that the bishop of Jensis Bul is being run in the direction of the Iusta route.
He, too, will build his message.
In the previous day, I was a blessing service for a celebration of a celebration of the vigour.
Last year, I paid tribute to Pope Franciska, Laucompuo si, and an update of the common house in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I watched what is happening in the world and I am trying to respond to it.
My approach coincided with the church's suggestion that a message of cohabl should be put in the centre of life.
It needs to be shown that the Evaelite responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him an inspiration for a further journey.
Then it speaks people.
But, in Ciest, the Lamps, you said, 'I have to go back to the pile'.
What do you mean by that?
Does that mean that a person has taken away from a church's message?
And is the church today the source of such a return?
There are dead men dead in the capital of the Indian capital.
In the capital of India, no one has liked to know about a dead man dead in the capital - it turns out that he has seized the road on the side of the road, and then the BBC has been informed.
A man who has been identified as Mativisl was a day in the day with his or her sleep.
Matisl 5: 30 of the morning, walked down the road when he has been trapped by a light car.
The recording of the watchdog shows that the driver came out of the car to look at the victim and then gone.

Halight of his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (Revenue Service), Inga Kolegova, the head of the National Environment Service, received the government from the fall of the Latvian University of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
The clarification of the statement on the withdrawal of candidates for the conflict in the governing coalition is attributable to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
He told the hearing that he would find it difficult for him to imagine that next week the government would be in favour of Kolegova's candidacy.
So if the Unity Ministers vote against, but Kolegow was voted against and approved, it would lead to a government demission.
The expert also considers that, before the announcement of the nomination, Kolegow has been consulted both with the Finance Minister, Danu Reiznieci-Ozegg, and the Prime Minister of Ministers, Mars Kuchinski.
At the same time, it is also a concession to the Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
It is two options to find the appropriate candidate to find a suitable candidate for the competition, or a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution as Director General will continue to be managed in the Dace Pelbuilding.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance said so far that no other candidate had been considered, it was a cool in the Pelsin that there should be no tender.
According to LETA, Kolegow has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director of the Revenue Service.
As a result of the 'Unity' objection, the government postponed its approval of Kolegow on Tuesday to a post of Director-General of the Revenue Service.
Following the government's decision to postpone its decision, Kolegova remains ready to become a head of the Revenue Service.
However, a later change of thought was made, on Friday, the Minister of Finance, Danai Reizniecei-Ozoals, who withdrew his consent to the seat of the Revenue Service, and that she did not have an easy choice.
Prime Minister Mar Kuchinska Press Secretary, Andrei Vaivars, told LETA that a new competition will be organised on the post of Directorate General of the Revenue Service.

The Latvian National Arts Museum (LNMM) will be deploying alert marks, pictograms, a Baiba Gaelite told LETA.
It has now been successfully concluded that the museum stick-fired speed has been corrected, which has resulted from the activities of the skeypton.
The warning pictograms will be deployed over the days to come.

Up to a playground, a new, colour coup of a new colour was hindered from the street.
The hunt has been released for a renovated road.
Minister for Transport Ulster Augulis, VAS Latvian National Tests (LVC), as well as Binders of the VAS, and representatives of the local authorities today unveiled the border of the main road toward Russian border (Greekeva) -Resgavpils-Lithuanian border (hunts) from hunts to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,0km).
The roads are a country's visit, particularly for border routes, and so a particular pleasure is to reveal a reconstruction of the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the cofinancing of the European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"As forecasts, the means available for roads during this programming period will already be released in 2018, and we must think of continuing to sustain the most busy roads in a very good quality, and also to secure citizens' mobility in all Latvian regions without European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis.
The Minister for Transport also pointed out that the proposals made by road experts on sustainable funding for Latvian roads will be presented to the government at an early time.
In the period from Medal to Lithuania border (156,4-163,0km), SIA Binders started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of aid is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was co-financed by the project.
"The construction phase has a full renovation of the road map and will start repairs at the next stage from Medal to its own Daugavpilij, so that the entire route from Lithuania's border to Daugavpilij was put in order, and the President of the LVC board said, Janis Lange.
The country's main roads are most burdened, and until 2018 we are going to make sure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next challenge will be to maintain them in good quality, to maintain the periodic maintenance and to take the replacement of asphalt surpluses every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require appropriate funding, and all trawers look forward to the proposals of the expert group to put the road funding system in order," said Mr Lange.
The project sets out road links and lighting in the centre of the Medal.
Significant land work is carried out: in four sections, large-scale detracting and funding-out works, the longituds which hitherto were very uneven.
Public transport has also been updated and renovated for public transport.
In the past, there was an unleashed uncosture and a relateur of areas was not transparent due to the mounting valves, as well as the way in which the way the way is shared.
The next season for construction works is scheduled to be restored from the city of Daugavpils at the time of reconstruction (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, the LVC intends to take various types of work more than 1100 kilometres of the country's roads.
Information on all repairs planned in the national road network this year is available at the LVC homepage at www.enceli.encelane.
"In order to achieve the desired weight reduction, there is a very important choice of food combinations," recognises the Lithuanian dietary, Laura Romeraite-Proceliersocieties.
In addition, this is easy for the summer period, when we have fresh fruit, ores and vegetables on our own horses.
The combination of intended nutritional products can help not only to reduce overweight but also to target the various organism processes in a targeted manner.
Macro-hero and vinegar are a good combination, as a lasting sense of salt is provided and fats can be combated.
Studies published in the European Clinical Timebook have shown that the vinegar has a positive impact on glucose levels and helps us feel encouraging.
Dowadays and proteins of proteins, such as poultry meat or proteins of proteins, produce not only a sense of salt but also reduce the temptations of high meals in the next meals.
Such a combination of meals can also increase by up to 35% of calorised calories.
Studies show that CCPs can help to get rid of the fat.
There is a holistic nutrient nutrient of a mess, a choline, while the pre is a good source of vitamin C.
A sufficient amount of these nutrients can reduce the level of corner, and that includes the accumulation of fat on the part of the body.
There is another garden of fresh ovens, another garden and flowers, an arson that is worth including in his mess.
Auza and oks contain the fibre that is controlled by the Canadian scientific findings under the greed of the greed hormones - and thus a sense of hunger.
In addition, olicies contain polyphenoes that are palpable in reducing weight, and they do not allow fats to form fats.
Describers and proteins are also able to carry out miracles in the reduction of weight.
Such a combination is capable of creating a sense of leverage.
Pressures contain water and fibre, therefore contribute to the sense of the welcome.
At the same time, protein is slowing down the greening process and provides a sense of salt for a longer period.
Distorts can be coached with salts, or also to produce proteins of proteins from finished mixture and enjoyed it together with their favourite vegetables.
No combinations of products.
There are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch that is in the vegetables is a polisalcharide.
The fruit of the cuit is mechanically split and chemically disaggregated, up to a third or a quarter in the digetic process taking place in zarnies.
The close is divided into three different stages, starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat an island immediately after the meal.
Give them a hunt right after the meal, it is "trapped" with other meals where it is not chemically distorted and is starting to work.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers or other carbohydrated products, along with citrones, luck, apelines, greiphaments, ananasons or other acids.
Basin ptialin, which is in snuts, works only in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids are not only hampered by carbohydrates but it also contributes to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs, cheese and eggs, meat and milk, eggs and milk, eggs or nuts, or nuts and similar proteins, or products of similar proteins.
Their processing is required for different digeing juices, each of them with varied strength, characteristics and time when it is to be entered in the magic.
Arctick, hungrlie, the muscace and other melons must always eat separately from other meals.
The blacklist is not confusing if it is located in cucumbers with other foods.
Farmers have a combination of protein products.
The economies form a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said for fat and protein, the fat impedes proteins of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
Large quantities of protein products are consumed, avoid using fat at all.
It also covers fresh, it is not advisable to combine a large number of nuts (containing proteins) with a whole source of fat (containing fat).
Such a combination impedes effective weight reduction.
How to better prepare?
"Cooking, the processing of thermic processing results in a significant loss of nutrients - approximately 15% to 55% of the original nutrient profile of products."
In most cases, nutrients are lost in food production.
However, the nutritional value of some food products is rising directly by weak ones.
It is advisable to use the staunch liquid for soundness: in this case, you will not lose the nutrients that are left in the water and may eat them later.
It is advisable to prepare the fruit, including stealing them.
The processing of calculations significantly increases the availability of liquid seed in tomatoes.
With tomatoes of 30 minutes, the quantity of licopeds will be increased by 25%.
The bioavailability of betaskin, which is to be found in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, the sights, the sweet potatoes and fins, is also significantly increased.
The processing of ports of meat and meat shall remove the natural properties of the proteins present in them, making them more easily accessible.
Likewise, the processing of meat and egg termiss makes them more easily absorbed in an organism.
It should also be borne in mind that product freezing can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, and not affect the island of fibre.
A combination of tomatoes with tomatoes can increase Iron eating in the organism, which in turn provides a better functioning brain and muscle.
Our organism ranges up to 33% of non-blood borne iron found in plant products such as beds, sheets, cereals, than the bloodshed iron found in products in the animal of animals such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of un-blood iron iron by the use of non-blood borne iron products, along with Vitamin sources, such as airbags, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change un-blood fertility, so that we can absorb it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of chickygen, which provides oxygen to musckeys and brains.
To maximise the benefits of salmon, add healthy fat, such as olive or linseseed oil.
Take cheerings with the lash, add the rich or didn of vitamins, the rich of vitamins, which is a good source of calculations.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcued calcued calculations and plays a significant role in the process of bone.
Obeds (as well as other gracels), along with vitamin sources, such as strawberries, upbees, avenes and other fruit or coal, contribute to stabilizing the cholesterol level and avoid misunderstanding of arteries.
Wholesale of Snapchat "Anime"
Snapchat has said that this filter was inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that this is racist insensitivity.
This slow effect on Snapchat allows 150 million users to change the reality in all absurd ways in a sense of absurdity and playing with their identity.
You can turn yourself into an ananol, dog or image fed up by the Roja Lihštenstein.
Cod is spraying, imaging instruments that generates more than 30 million selfans per day.
Any error shall be rapidly made public.
There has been some criticism in the past, with the accusation of the excestion of the excessively black or light like the ideal old beauty.
This week, new slowdown effects were published, allowing users to build a ham, sorts of sorts and shots, and some critics called it a racist hill cartoony.
The question was also raised as to whether such contradictions do not show that the company has more problems with diversity.
The outbreaks of the report and of the public negation came out on Wednesday when expenditure on the Verge and Motherboard said that the slow effects were taken out of the strain.
The company explained that the lens-target is to portray the image of Anyarl rather than hibing people of origin.
However, people who have seen racism have been reminded of these effects by painful stereotypes.
Others categorically deny the similarity with the Anime.
On Twitter, Greisas Sparapani, the American Art of Arts of origin, won a broad resonance on the images in the E-mail letter, saying that the slow effects were "offensive and inconvenient to say" no more. "
She added that it is difficult not to see the obvious similarity between the cartoons of aziates and the slower effects.
This shows that the lens-effect is not easy to yield but the yellow was sealed against racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
The American culture, too, is engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion from business premises to Holivai and the devices we use in everyday life.
And Snapchat's big young people, who represent a variety of race, unlike the elderly, are more sensitive to such matters.
If Snapchat lenslake phere a picture that is insulting users, "nowadays does not go unnoticed nowadays," he said in an interview with 25 years ago, Keitija Žou.
On Thursday, a product manager of the Medium product, Žor ercized his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In his article on Medium and telephone interviews, she explained that she feels that there is a race in the race with the employment policy of Snapchat, which is insufficient in favour of racial diversity.
He criticized the management of the company, which was made up of the white men and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial diversity in the company, which makes it possible for such decisions to be made, but they are working in some other racial representatives, but they do not take the post to be able to express their opinion in a secure and comfortable way."
They also agree with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many workers are represented by different race, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but its representative showed that the company had a staff professional who will focus on the representation of racial minorities, which are not widely represented and that it will be encouraged to be included in the company.
However, I am not going to update my own Snapchat account, adding: 'I wonder whether they really need more users like us to understand that it is not right'.
The House of Congress states that military officials missed reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress in Congress notes that the representatives of the Central European Union of Central America have been making reports of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than in fact.
The analysts of the central parliamentary intelligence service are of general dissatisfaction at the interim report of the task unit established by the Republican representatives of the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Finance Subcommittee, indicating that their management had been controlling the American successes in the fight against Islamic Valsti.
The reward, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tamil, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
Recent news of this report notes that the intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than it has been in fact; the facts were regularly distorted by means of better achievements than other intelligence services.
Kalifornia's Republican Republican spokesman: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy-makers get false messages."
Centcom management errors are sought by the senior management of the organisation.
This 10 pages report highlights the current challenges of reflection and analysis of the American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide unreasonable evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration would have made reports, it shows that the Centcom's leadership has made some pressure on analysts to have a more optimistic view on the Islamic State (also known as ISS or ISIL).
The report points out that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Management Press Release, notifications and reports in Congress picked the situation in a significantly more positive light than was actually the case.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly stated that the recovery operation of Mosul could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city of Iraq, which remains under the control of the Islamic State.
The Republican Republican spokesperson, Mr MaCork Pompeo, said: 'A multi-month investigation shows this clearly'.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the key officials of the central management of the central government were misrepresented by picking the dangers of the ISIS in Iraq than they were in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are worried that the Islamic State is being missed.
The report released on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The Ministry of Defence shall carry out the investigation of the activities of the Centcom intelligence services.
The Democratic Party member Democratic Party member Democratic Party members presented their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party's working group.
Added to Addka Schifs in his report stories from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of reports from the intelligence services in relation to the ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr Schifa explains that this process' suspended the dissemination of information ', aggravated analysts' working ethics and 'distributed the unsatisfactory facts'.
But Siff and Democratic Party members added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to a "predetermined or political line."
The Daily Beast of Thursday published the provisional results of the Congress's investigation.
In August, the New York Times said that the Directorate General of the Pentagon launched an investigation after the Centcom analysts.
Pentagon, lieutenant commanus Patriks Evans said that the Pentagon would not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation continues.
He added that experts sometimes interpret complex data, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence administration invite a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about whether an American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (a statement made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Manager on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism for Islamic State intelligence reminds us more than ten years of events when the Centcom intelligence analyst carried out the study by Gregorium Houkers stating that the administration of Afghanistan was launched by the Afghan War too little for its possible consequences.
The hotel has also played an important role in the public intelligence of the Islamic State.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hush team found that the financial position of the terrorist group had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the Islamic State oil factories, as they had constructed temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of the Times reported that this discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Manager.
Between now, Centcom commanis of General Loid Ostins III received sharp criticism, as many lawmakers thought that the war was too positive.
In April, General Ostins took leave and was replaced by General Jos Votels.
The United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States, the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States.
The day after win over Japan with the outcome of 6: 1, Thursday in Keitija, the first two guns of the U.S. was in favour of a wife for women with an Indian team with the result of 3: 0.
Five guns in two games are an unforfortable achievement, but 27 years old said he was unable to remember, or had she ever succeeded.
She said, 'I have no idea.'
I am not one of those people who run their guns.
But she knows that the American result of the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them a non-attached Britain in their group, a result of which Japan has won a result 2: 0 remained unwon.
The UK and the US will be meeting on Saturday to break the game of the first round.
The two teams already qualify for a quarter of the finishing and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six-pack group and which is the second.
The winner of the first place will be a little longer to hold a meeting with the strong Dutch sample, which is the leader of the second group.
Ahead of the game, the Americans have already called a storm by the Americans, four years ago, having the last place of 12 teams in London.
There was also Bam in the team.
She picked up his first time in the night of her night for her first time in his nightmare, and she joined the National izure when she was 16-year-old when she was 16-year-old, becoming random in the history of the youngest players.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because they were not in the finger.
However, 2012 has been a failure for her and her team.
In the next year, English Kregs Parhama was appointed and everything changed to the better.
It called 'cultural, mentality and physical change'.
In London we did not invest as much as now.
We have changed everything.
On Thursday, Bam played a result in the first half of the game with the rear from the near distance.
India's game came out without victory in his own account, but their selection was very fierce and lasting a minimum of 0: 1 to the end of the third period, when Bam restored the gates.
She went into a bomb in the opponent left of the left, and then looked to the middle of the countryside and send a bomb to the opponents of the opponents, channelling the Americans 2: 0.
The middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalesa, has yet to win.
This was the first droughshot of the US Bridail Bridle, each of the first three games to be filled by one gateway.
She has gone down.
And I too.
"We're going very well at the moment," Pahama said, but how very good it will be on Saturday.
The most pressing meal of the depression period is the 'Say Maltite'.
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Berklist Delano Rugly had been caught in a sealed ovich to keep the meal.
The President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, told the House that "we're going to have a big picture of the future of Europe," he said.
On that occasion, his maller was much more modest: measured in the mayor of egg tomatoes, the potatoes and the desert - flood fans.
He said: "This is the way to show solidarity with people who have been very hard to prepare."
"It is also a message to the Americans to eat," she said.
A couple of Brooklyn Heights is a cooking historians.
The Chinese virus in America, but Zkelmane, has been described in the headline of Kohl in America, but Ziegelmane has been described in his book at the ear of the eating in the East of Hill in the East of Hill.
Their new joint work on the 'Intelligent maling', which Harper published on Tuesday, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
There was a show of solidarity in the culinity, they were stubbornly confused with Eisenberg's Shop, a simple lunch estuary in the Flatiron district and works from 1929 when the big depression began.
For 54 years, Ms Ziegelmanship ordered his butter with the rubled cheese and the captive oves, while 57 years old Kou ordered the thouter, potatoes and vegetables.
When reporters ordered the fake green paper, it was said that his choice was very relevant to the talk of the Great Depression period.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said that the counterfeit dog was very popular.
There was a green nock, a rack husk and a hide lag.
They were made up of basic ingredients and other ingredients enriched aside.
Think of how it is - eat so much of the ground to be half a day instead of half a day.
Mr Kou was blamed.
"The storders are very likely to have lead," he said.
The American lunk on the American lunch coincided with the Swedish gallery, especially in rural areas.
Women were going to eat to their male workers and brocketed, dinner and dinner were given the fresh coatings.
During the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans eating to the day, the 'intelligent meal' describes how the Americans had to adapt to the conditions in which the Americans were suddenly no longer.
"At that time, the food became an object of key attention to the American people on a daily basis," Mr Kohl, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on the subject.
The new specimen of the new budget were just as important: uncertain meals such as the counterfeit dog and tramings became everyday, the combustion was "an excellent way of using surpluses," said Zarelmanes, who could hide the unhesitant parts below the metal.
The fruit of fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which for years was the primary ingredient of an American maller, became an extremely rare luxury good.
At a time when calorum and food nutrient was more important than taste, new, unseen ceases.
In one old book, Mrs Ziegelmanes found a prescription on how to prepare the tiny butter on the butter.
Mr Kohl added: 'This was not a popular lunch supplement'.
"It was surreal."
It is not compatible with the use of the pot butter and the cept of the pot.
Many homes on ethics were going through the difficult times.
Such household economises like the head of the Economic Office of the Federal Ministry of Households from 1923 to 1943 gave national eating habits that were not known before the Great Depression.
In the publication of articles and prescriptions in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that they become 'economics' and adopt challenges such as translating a magazine and a carrot in a cabulous meal.
The 'Intelligent Malclean' is a historic peace of history.
Evidently interesting is evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herman Hemver, for example.
Although publicly he told him of his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, he was in fact like a baby mile he had become.
Mr Kohl said: "He did Europe's kitchen, for example with cucumbers."
He was eating almost the gold in the guest, wearing a lunch.
He was completely separated from reality.
President Rigs would have made the same mistake, as his wife had not advised him for an example with his eating habits.
The paper tells us that the Rate was a domestic worker who was not taught to eat, and so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most untamount people in Washington was given, but also the worst of the meals."
As soon as the public economy finds itself, most depression era has disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional values and how to use science in culinary, added Ziegelmanes.
The rest is that, in writing, they have gained greater awareness of the eating habits of Ziegelmanes, for example, why she was unable to throw out the food.
"She was afraid to throw out the mess," Mr Kohl said.
Ms Ziegelmanes said: "She actually tracted people."
There was a incident of wind turbulence.
When we had eaten in the Eisenberga, the writer's couple of deserts were cooked from the bags in the bags, which the President of the President used to eat in dinner.
"This is a bottle of fluids," said Ziegelmanes, adding that, at that time, the habit of a modest mess had been distributed.
It has no half-taps, only dried flows, a little miles, sugar, water and a canal.
All of them were intolerable in the wounded mass of the war on the plate.
It was not so bad, as a matter of urgency.
Mr Kou eaten a few more kumosus.
Looking at an experienced 'economist' he said, "he said," he said.
Gilead to be repaid for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck on the Hepatitis C patent
The judge has decided that the Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal services they paid for the field of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted to a two-Merck patchment, which was threatened with successful Solemi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found irregularities in Merk, such as meddling and other unethical activities.
On Thursday, the US County Judge Bet Laborson Fran said that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for the legal expenditure that it has to take in the case.
Merck is attempting to gain positions on the market against Gilead, which is dominated by the new generation Hepatitis C medicinal product, which is an effective 90% of illnesses.
The case was launched already in 2013 when Gilead and Merck had to take one another in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active components of the solubuvir, which is part of the Gilead medicinal product.
The US support forces say they have completely taken over the city of Manbidge from the Islamic State.
The US supported forces have completely taken over the city of Manbidden in the northern part of the city of Manbidden in the northern part of the country, and the last City of the Islamic State has left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDS) currently attles the city from the last opponents of the opponents who have not left the city yet.
They have freed more than 2,000 militant civilians who had been hosted by militants, the news agency Suter Darvik of the SDS's Manbidden military council told Reuter.
"The city is now under full control of our control and we are carrying out a fighter," he told the Agency Reuters.
Clinton earnings reached USD 10.75 million in 2015 and paid a couple of €34,2 per cent.
Clinton released the 2015 Tax Declaration on Friday, which shows that the presidential candidate and her husband have earned USD 10.75 million in this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34,2 percent in this year.
In 2015, Clinton has donated USD 1 million, mainly for her Clinton charity, former president Bill Clinton earned approximately 5.3 million dollars from the floor as a Speaker and a former Secretary of State with an income of 3 million dollars from his book on the country's Departamenit published in cooperation with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton elections - US Senator Timber Keins and his wife and his wife published his tax declaration on the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 percent.
Clinton and Tims Keins continue to set new standards for financial transparency, "Clinton campaigner Jenifera Palace said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is behind the various pretexts and the reservations, so that the promises of disclosure of their tax information should not be met.
The publication of outstanding tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but this is not required by law.
Trump and his lawyers commemorate the audit of the national income service as a reason to discover tax information.
"Tather marry," on his Twitter site, she told Clinton's campaign partner Ians Sami.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser Maikls Kohen told the CNN that he will not allow Trump to publish his tax information before the audits have been completed.
Trump critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mur Romney and the Republican Republican, claim that his refusal raises questions about his true volume of property, the amounts of donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton committed oils to the fire on Friday, where a number of influx retardants demand Trump to publish their tax information.
She reverted to this issue during an economic speech on Thursday in MiGyigan.
She announced the breath: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Polytico says that over the 1990s Trump has paid very little or no taxes at all and the New York Times business column said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a fundamental issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in favour of a billion billion dollar Bafeta proposal, promotes the idea that each with more than USD 1 million a tax should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, Clinton's' Berkshire Hathaway 'conglomerate also called for Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Bafets said that he also had a Revenue Service audit and Trump was afraid of the electorate and not by the tax authorities.
Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton now live at the bottom of Clinton, New York, and between 2007 and 2014, has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which $109,000 has been watered down by Clinton.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin on the removal of an Israeli standend at the time of which the RT's
The French film maker of French designations of origin made a storm on social media when it discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel has not been available to the Israeli negotiating code in Berlin, justifying this by the Arab client.
Kloars Lancmans, documentaries for the Holocaust director Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Hotel in Kempinski Bristol at the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find a list of the hotel of Israel's long-distance negotiations.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which it is directly from the hotel number.
How is it that in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel is slavery and destroyed?
President Lancmans.
Instead, the hotel of Kempinski's hotel offers a call to the country through its call centre.
He asked for an explanation from the hotel.
I write to Lancmans that the answer I received 'shocked him' was the answer.
The administrator of the Hotel explained that "it was known to be a hotel control decision."
The reason for the withdrawal of coding has been further sanctioned by the film maker.
"The vast majority of visitors are Arabs and they demanded an Israeli code," Lancmans quoted an interpretation of the hotel worker.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Israeli ambassador in Germany, Jakovs Had-Handelsman, had described the case as a 'big shame'.
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That is a great shame on its own.
And the fact that this has happened precisely in Germany is that there is even more humiliation in this hotel network.
No clarification is needed.
"We hope that the hotel has to draw the right conclusions."
This event has also prevailed on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others think that the Kempinski hotel had simply damaged the Arab customer.
Another article said 'shame', saying that the hotel was in the street of Kurfurstendamm near synagogai.
The verdict at Ler Spiegel says that the hotel itself had rejected all the rediscards by saying that all of this was' misunderstanding 'and apologised to Lancmy.
"We have not been directly obliged to take Israel from the list of national numbers," Sudan said.
And to add that the code was again added to the list.
The police are using rubber bullets and tear gas to protesting for Brazilian students.
Students and police collisions took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaula, Brazil, where students gathered demonstrations against the reform of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas to students.
The problems began when the Ombudsman attempted to scrap the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to show their reluctance to reforms of the education system.
The proposal is to close almost 100 public schools by Geraldo Alckmena, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators have been marked on cheese grafist with messages against the caretaker President Maikh Temeru.
This protest was held only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for the commemorated President of Dilma Rousefai, whose implicit vote was voted by a Senate.
Best of Scotland, Skiners first wished to untie Britain for a golden meal
Kniners from Scotland was finalising the first male wheeled trip on the Rio Licycle season, which took place last night: the British team safeguarded his chamber's title, which was won in the game of the City of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old athletes played an important role in the races of Glasgova by making pride of legitimate Scottish Seru Krisu Holy and a victory for the favourite New Zealand.
Five years ago, Britain had a surprisingly win when the Host fought the fifth of its six medals in the Olympic gold.
And they also repeated it at the World Cup in London, even though the Hotel had already ended his career.
The problem was at the stage between the Olympic Games in Beijing and the London Olympics, because they had to replace the experience of an experienced ray of Dr. Stafa.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When Holy went away, his place was attempted to fill in Channel Emadi and Mets Krampton.
British trainers put their hopes on the Skiner and see the potential that he later proved.
Hindes, Kenya - Championships of four years ago worked together with Holy and Skiners who installed a record of Olympic qualifications, but a better start was for New Zealand
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hins were in the bedrock after his kall, Kenney was leading, and the Skiners safeguarded this leadership.
The change of strategy played an important role in the win, as Hindes were driving a higher carry-out to allow Kenya and, in particular, the Skiner, to travel more quickly.
Holy races were watched as BBC's spokesperson and tracked in the eyes of the Skiner, Kenyan and Hindex eyes when they got to the honoured guideline.
23 years old glazgolan said: "This was an unfortunate honour."
I am doing everything to defend my name.
In the end, we installed the Olympic record and won the World Cup.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better win.
After their victory with Kenya and the Holy Olympic Games in London, they will be in London at the 2012 Olympic Games, Hindes will have to know that they were blamed on the wall of the wall.
Later he replayed his comment and the British competitors had nothing to prove the opposite.
This time, there were no incidents.
Hink said: "Britain's flags remembered London."
Over the last 3 months we have become a frozen team.
We have lost so many of the World Cup, so the Olympic game was really special.
One meter will be for a country that won seven of the ten gold medals of cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In the face of the result of Kenya, he could really reiterate the success of the Hoja by gaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, that would mean six hunted gold and one silver meal, and Kenya has also been born on 23 March (it seems to be British's sacred date, as Staly Regretch and Banister was born of the day).
The Hole was born on this day.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Boltton said: 'I will just understand it all now.
It is always the best option for a package.
Because, then, it can be won with teammen.
Quite honestly, it's a little lonely to win. "
"If he takes another two gold, he should be named as a arm of the arm."
On that day it was the only struggle for the medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlium Vigins, Eds Klensium, Stalive Burks and Oveins Douls showed the fastest time of a four-kilometre qualification.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The world's record, launched in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the end will take place today in the second half of the day, where there will certainly be more emphasis on the other side of the day.
Yesterday, before his qualification, he had a disagreement with the commission, when the judges called him to measure his / her fruit.
Today, Laura Trota, Journanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barkere and Keitija Archibalda, took a new record of 4: 260.
The British delegation hopes that the British bicycling team will win the medals of the Olympic Games in the cerosis.
Looking back the excellent and non-past performance in Beijing and London, all of us expect the same progress towards the Rio process.
Meanwhile, the scenes have gone differently, following accusations of sexism and tribute, with the resignation of a technical director of the Sheins Saturday, and the Hole and Viktoria Bendleton also stopped a career.
However, as early as cycles, it seems that Britain as always will reach the highest levels in time.
The future of the Portland Battle becomes uncertain, as an ambitious treaty breaks out.
The future of the Aluminium slaughterhouses and hundreds of its employees in Portland has become uncertain, as the main client has announced a cessation of cooperation.
This communication is based on the plans of the Viktor Government to end subsidies of the energy company, which is of vital importance for the company to continue its work.
The subsidies of 20 years will be suspended in November.
As a result, the jobs of more than 2 000 Portland plants are at risk.
Up to 2000 of both direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unforeseeable side effects, as the deceased is consuming about 10 per cent of all Victor's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa was the point of Point Henry, which led to an disruption of the Anthlelal power plant.
The Battle of Portland works against losses and could be shut down.
These events were caused by a series of years of speculation on the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of plant production.
The energy supplier "AGL" generating energy from its Loy Yang A power station Latroubs in Iège says that the other three owners are likely to cease their contracts.
Most of the power stations belong to the Alcoa and Alumia joint undertaking, in addition to the company's share, also include the Chinese "Marubeni Corp" Holding companies.
The AGL is hoping for the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further melting of the energy supply, "the spokesperson said.
AGL said contracts were the so-called "risk restrictive contracts" to come into effect from November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month validity period and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts, also in the 2017 fiscal year, "the company spokesman said.
From 2018's impact on profits, the beneficial market forecasts for future wholesale energy prices are constrained by profits.
AGL says that its forecasts have already estimated losses of USD 187 million, which will be suspended.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate the contracts would not affect the ability of Alcoa to continue the operation or to deliver its energy supply.
The US company says that in 2010 it concluded the contract with LY Yang for 20 years, but it will be stopped in November, and the company does not explain why it will stop cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the alleged closure of the Portland Battorhouse in Victor Habin and closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, industry's weak economy.
The AGL Executive Director, Stalive Mikelson, said last week that 600 megavans and Tomago 900 megavans were used in the Portland during the year.
If both of these plants come from the energy market, then energy demand would be reduced considerably.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
More than 160 000 people are being rejected every year, and the budget cuts, the situation could worsen.
Three out of the five people in Kosland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal extermination, are refused free legal aid and representation.
The legal centre of the Community, which has already been overloaded, warns that the situation will only become worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
Diegim Farels, the Director of the Legal Centre of the Rulsland, said that the latest Association report of the National Legal Centre for Justice said that, at the moment, legal aid has been refused to the thousands of people in need of it.
Mistrs Farel said that if this decision is not lifted, then the situation would become worse.
He said: "The wine-gun legal centre is constantly underfinanced, meaning that the aid is being refused for thousands of people in need of it."
People who are struggling to put an end to violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are living in divorce, workers who are dishonestly dismissed - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that many thousands of wine-slanded people will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General of Attorney and the Cansland Senator, Brande, to halt the funding cuts immediately so that people who need legal aid can gain it.
Last year, the government launched its plans to raise the level of legal aid up to the country's average level.
It is now time for us also to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to invest in this important domain by the Palazčuka Government.
Donald Trump's campaign flown to court as one of its employees displayed a firearm
New York: organisers of the Donald Trump campaign have been brought to court as they did not take action, as they have not acted on information that the driver of its North Carolina Operator opened a firearm against a worker when they were in a single car in February.
This incident was described in a court's claim submitted to a Vincent Bordini, a former campaigner of the campaign, on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for his internal scrutiny, but understood that this would not be the case.
Driving the pistol of the Philippines, the Philippines, put his good-pointing finger on the light and paved the way for the final trip, "Bordini said in his complaint.
He also says that by means of complaints to local and regional campaigning, Bordini learned that at least four people have experienced the same.
"They do not have to shoot out in order to be a loss," says Bordini's complaint.
Only two days before the file was submitted, the Republican party's candidate led a scandal to people saying that "the second people," i.e. the owners and enthusiassives, could act in the event of the election win of his rival Hillary Clinton and his judges elected.
The Trump campaign stated that the media had missed his words from the context and he never waited for violence.
Bordini, with his claim, wants to recover compensation from campaigner for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines, for attacks, illegal weapon use and emotional stress generation.
The Trump representative Houpa Hiks did not comment immediately.
It has not been possible to communicate with the Philippines.
WCCB - Smaller's local news agency stories that the Philippines have recently left the campaign.
It has also failed to call his consultancy firm "Innovation Services."
Donald Trump has been a controversial electoral campaign for the Republican presidential candidate.

A new tradition, pedelight and sports celebrations in Cirmount.
On Saturday in Cirty, people gathered for the first time on paint and sports crews.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that the Ezer Holy will no longer be.
A new page has now been broken down.
The day began with sporting competitions.
This time the competition was not traditional in traditional forms and is too serious, because, for example, the shock had to be met in a guest, a book flight, a man of the left, 'bombying' has not existed in the unknown Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, luck and attachment are.
After sports games, all of them pulled out on the holiday of a holiday where the blebles started.
In the meantime, the 'child corner' was also working, where little could be lost to the impoverished mines and to gain a new image in the face of the season.
A new phenomenon that could also become a tradition has been a driving force, with both tractors and motorcycles.
All of them were addressed by Inga Kadibran, the head of the government of Chalvile, who wished a nice leisure and droughts, but it was intrinsically able to obstruct it.
The stories continued with the uprising of the youngest population.
It is really good that the peak has been completed with five girls and one pute.
The midwifers had a post of amateur art from the Engures nose - the viewers very beaten Seniora desk club of the Autumn of the various nations and the 'Golden monks' of the young people.
And it's nothing that there was a slip on the wet.
Of course, the local people and the villa of the villages were wearing the famous duce of Jānis Jarane and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildians and Clear Channel, as well as chilled wives from fishermen.
The prize was played by the Bruciis group.
Britain must keep the Olympic spirit and expand the Chrytrova.
It will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my view, makes Chlorries very attractive, as is the case in London in 2012, where we put an enormous amount of work to all the regions of the country from the Olympics.
The Olympic Games and the staggage were given a huge amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities not far from Heathrow.
Local communities alone will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and will finally put an end to the unemployment of young people in the surrounding area.
Just as the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will be people going to be too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain will never be prepared to prepare for the Olympic Games and that this will be a global failure.
The questioners were wrong about 2012 and they will not be right in the case of Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Chile has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Chile is an infrastructure project which will benefit the whole of society rather than individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a soil for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
An excellent team has been working in Heathrow, with an investment programme of 11 billion pound infrastructure with a terminal of 5, five years from the site of the best airport terminal in the world and finally with a terminal for 2, which has been built between the two more intense roads in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third scam which will be funded with a private investment of 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 was an excellent success and I am sure that it will also be the enlargement of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and broaden Chile, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Pols Deiton is a member of the Chile board and former Secretary of Economic Affairs of the Economy.
In Switzerland, the woman is running on the superroad, trying to commit suicide.
They went on the grand night of the night.
The police are trying to find witnesses in the event of an accident involving several cars over the early morning of Thursday.
The accident took place shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the Morges town of Vo canton.
The Vo Cantons police report says that he wished to suicide, the woman had gone on the road in the dark where they had several cars.
Clearly, trying to kill, victims, 49 years old, run several cars, including heavy machinery.
She died at the scene.
A number of accidents involving accidents have already provided evidence, while others have not yet been clarified, says the police, who are calling for the involvement of drivers and witnesses in the accident.
The case has also started a criminal investigation which, in this case, is a logical step, was told by a lawyer, Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Did it have been possible to evade collisions?
Hofstellers added: "This will be explained by the public prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have taken place over the last five years show that none of the drivers is brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrip in mid-night had gone on the superroad, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that a pedestrian would be on the superroad at midnight, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted to kill behind a blind eye when she passed a man on the night of the night of the A1 road from Payerne in August 2014.
The Court of Justice found that the victim had been drugby for 22 years and later noticed the journey on the road.
The Court found that the police were driving the case to the case in an appropriate way and the judge admitted that the guest man was "completely unpredictable and exceptional".
Anyone who has been informed of the accident near Morges, has been called upon to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The internet is poorly signed by the internet to organise a new Revenue Service's post.
Avaaz.org launched the signature of signatures for the organisation of a new director of the National Navigation Service (SSA).
The minister addressed to ministers from the National Alliance (NA) and the Greens / Farmers' Union (Greens / Farmers) states that the public wants the process of nomination of transparent and professional officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and 55 people have now signed it.
The process of nomination of Inland Kolegow, Director of the Director General of the Revenue Service, is untransparent and unprofessional.
It replaces the best traditions of the functionaries of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and, once again, makes the public disappointing in the government and the politicians.
"There is a need for competition with clear criteria that all candidates have to assess," the text of the letter of petition.
He pointed to the fact that the public did not know the criteria as Kolegow selected for the post.
Also, it is also unclear as to what the candidate is in the job of working in the Revenue Service.
It argues that the State Chancellery should build a new, open competition, with active candidates, associated personal-selection experts and adequate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola was officially designated last week as head of the Slegova VID, but the whole of the 'Unity' ministers voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilohimself: If we lost, that is bad.
At the Olympic Games, Alexander Samoilov and Janis Schmenu had hoped for an award to be awarded to the Olympic Games, but there are no discrepancies between the race after leaving Samoilovs.
One of the world's most powerful beaches on the top of the reward spells on Thursday was the final and decisive game with 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15), the Brazilian Oliveiru, and Pee Solbergam, in the middle of the four-year-old sports forum.
Latvian athletes won a win over three games, but the same was the same as two of the two couples.
In addition, three couples of small points of mutual interest were counted after this masse had the most unfavourable loss of loss to the Latvian duce.
"We were in the first place with the lead, but from 16: 15 to 16 points," Knicks remembered the game of the game.
I do not know how the remaining part of the sixth is left without points.
It must not play it.
After that, the second season was in order and the game of the seum was successful, and it should have been a good basis for the third season.
They started in the same way, but after the parties changed the result, only a single team was the result of changing the parties.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group, all the teams were similar, almost all of the masses had three seals, so it was small points.
"We need to play a better role than to reward 3-4 points in a row," said the athlete.
We knew that the Evancane could be serted.
"We had the first season with it, the second in the second lap of 1-2 points, and the third of the + 4 left a game," Knicks said.
We tried to show the best game.
They met, momently not.
It was known that as many small points had been as possible as possible to the status of the joint evaluation.
"If we lost, that's bad," said Samoilovs.
There was a good server from the Evancane and it was very good in the first six, but the third opened up serve and was hard to throw out the attack.
On the other hand, I was quite wrong with the Pee serves but we had to deal with it.
Samoilovs said that, against a previous match, the athletes did not have a nervous today.
"We played, we have protected, we had to be better," he said.
"They played well and they had to come to the urite."
Before the turnament, I said immediately that the loaze was the worst thing that could have been.
We had the prospect of fighting for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us expected the meter, and we too have been, but there are no differences between 25 and a quarter of us," Samoilovs said, who predicted that the duce will continue to play together in the future.
I think that the question will not be and will continue to play together, because this is just one turbull.
Samoilovam was already in a career in the third Olympic Games, since in 2008 he started to work with Mārtièhim in Beijing, but four years ago, London played together with Ruslanu Sorokina.
Meanwhile, this was the second start of the Olympic Games in the Olympics.
Latvia's energy market is being followed up with the process of opening up the gas market with the position of the potential trader.
The state energy company Latvia energo is following the opening of the gas market, both from the consumer and the potential travenant, said Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether or not for the future" Latvia's gas market will be added as a trader will determine what the gas market model and the legal framework will be established. "
"That's why we are actively involved in the drafting and comment of legislative acts, as well as making your proposals," he said.
The BNS, the Agency, has already written to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulation Commission and the Latvian GuAsia, which will change the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market by giving natural gas users the right to free choice of natural gas traders from 3 April 2017.
By working towards a new market regulation for natural gas, the EM aims to make the natural gas trade process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly solution, the trader's central model is selected by the trader, one contract, one billing and one for the provision of information and customer service, leaving the technical issues of the distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We recall that household customers will be subject to a gradual market opening as well, after 3 April 2017, households who will not choose to choose another natural gas trader to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at the regulated price, thus becoming users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to the users for a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, economic operators will have to choose the natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
The natural gas trade in natural gas will be provided by the natural gas trader at the time of its specified price by the conclusion of a trade contract for natural gas for certain periods of time.
The draft Cabinet rules will set out in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall specify the rights and obligations of the users of natural gas to natural gas supplies, the rights and obligations of the owner of the natural gas system, the provision of the trader, the system operator, the user of the user and the gazeable facility; the procedures to be performed in the case of natural gas supply disruption; procedures for the supply of natural gas to the public by the public service.

Ministre: Addressing the remuneration of Director General of the Revenue Service next week.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers) is planning next week with Prime Minister Mars Kučinski (Greens / Farmers) and the government coalition partners to raise the salary of the Director General of the National Revenue Service (Revenue Service).
Reizniece-Ozola, on Friday, told journalists that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director General of the Revenue Service has to be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive to potential repeated tenderers.

The minister also stressed that she did not think of any particular candidate to speak of vacant posts.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola said that the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good director of the Revenue Service.
On the other hand, with regard to the current Revenue Service's Daci Peldt, who has stated his readiness to claim his post, the minister reiterated his view that the new Director-General of VID should have "side-off" and should not come from the Revenue Service's structure.
She also stressed that the Saeima would be waiting for the leave to be returned from the leave, so that the legislative amendments necessary for the reorganisation of the Revenue Service will be made as soon as possible.
The BNS has already reported that the Head of State for the Environment, Inga Kolegova, submitted an application to withdraw its candidacy for the post of Director-General of the Revenue Service.
As she said, it is not an easy option but, in the last two weeks, her relatives have been under severe emotional pressure, despite the fact that there is no law condemning the law.
Kolegova also pointed out that her nomination was a contradiction between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It is also reported that the former Director General of the Revenue Service, Inar Petersson, left the post at the end of June.

Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials and received a volume of the amount.
The relevant bank lending from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union Structural Funds support projects, which would have enabled the production of new production equipment to be purchased and the infrastructure to be modernised.

"There were a number of installations breached that provide a higher speed of production," said the company's management.
The management of the "Blue Web" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 would allow a company's plant to meet such orders that were not possible to date.
The first production party to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As there are already signs of intent on the sale of the product, the entire production will be sold in accordance with the intended protocols.
The new product will increase an turnover of around EUR 300 000 per month, "notes the company's management.

Due to a neighbourhood's renovation, a man is being printed under the feet and forced to leave their homes.
Dmitry Saidjaševo, a neighbour of the LTV broadcaster, called his neighbour's renovation of the capitalist renovation in his apartment, and since then he had discards from the Greeks, and it is unbelievable that there is a safe stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbours were arbitrarily constructed and, in my apartment, there are a defects.
I then informed the Riga construction board, the house manager and other organisations.
The building board said that we are not a kind of operational service and we do not have any expertise at all.
"The animal owner must go into Latvia's engineer of engineers and there will be a expert from there," Dmitry said.
The expert who has been invited came out, shell out and admitted that the cover had been unsatisfactory.
However, since first Dmitry substitution, a month has passed and, until the beginning of this week, it was unable to answer whether there is no life-threatening to live.
There is a lack of legislation in the board, waiting if you are not happy to write all in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they were transferred to a house manager, then the house manager again on the building board and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
It is clear from all the papers of the paper that the construction works have been stopped, sometime it can be heard that somebody is working there.
Within two months, there is a need for expertise to be carried out and, within six months, a residential owner who carries out repairs has to be prevented by all these defects.
The independent expert has developed its opinion, but the Governing Board considers this to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not pointed out whether the metal size of this unpromising structure has been hit, so it is not certain that the subsister home owner is a threat.
"That's why we have asked for additional clarification from this expert," Ilze Beckka, the representative of the Riga City Council.
Despite the ban on carrying out any renovation from the upper living, it is becoming ever more prone to building.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without construction permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a given case the penalty may be much harsher.
While an expert opinion is expected, the building board has taken a decision that both residences should not be exploited - both in their construction works and in the accommodation of Dmitry.
"This is the practice of the construction board in practice that, in this way, the population may have caused not only the property but also the sub-property owner, which will not be able to exploit his property," said the construction board.
It is now for the Dmitry to look for another place to live - to the radar, friends, hotel or other residential houses.
But Dmitry can seek to recover from a neighbouring civil legal round, which can take a great deal of time.
As a result of Patent Construction, the two lived stay is currently banned until the construction engineer will give its conclusion, and it may be expected to wait for even three weeks.
The damage will be borne by the owner of the home in which the repair works took place.
The owner of this residency because the construction board has not taken account of this is also a prison sentence of up to six months.

We felt at the same time at the time.
While we wrote, she was sitting on the accelerator.
Most of them could not suffer it.
We were able to do it, but not very successful, because we were very tight.
We were not secular but girls did not normally come to her inscription, they allowed us to operate.

NASA climate model: Venezuelan was a famous planet
On the basis of the latest climate patterns in NASA, Venera has once been an inhabitable planet.
The Institute of NASA's Goods Research Studies has developed a model to explore the Venezuelan history by means of tools and algorithms as well as climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere is almost exclusively of carbon, has once had similar conditions to the Earth.
Scientists have previously said that the slowdown of Venice has been explained by a densome atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus has ever had a plan, a similar atmosphere and it cut slowly.
The model also looked at the earliest topography of Venice.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but they have had enough water and geographical diversity in order to be able to form life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venera, the sun was 30 percent.
In the GISS model, the Venezuelan Greening Model reveals that the gay of the day will take place 2 months, the GISS scientist Sal Genio said in a press release.
This process spells the surface of the planet and gives rise to a case which, in turn, is a betraware of clouds that act as an umbrella to protect the planet from the solar heat.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is emerging, which is in fact some degrees below the Earth's time temperature.
The model illustrates the Venezuelan history, which is similar to the evolution theory developed by scientists in their mortgages.
Although ever it has been inhabitable, over several billion years, Venmba has been subjected to overhot and ultraviolet roes.
Its oceans were seizing and the spirits have been burdened by ultraviolet stars.
Dowadays have left completely the carbon atmosphere of the plan with a fatal greenhouse gas - Venera, as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venera climate model, the Geophysical Research Letters.
"Avalanche" lasts the Role of Avalanche
The Avalanche coach and Hockey coach and Hockeye Vice President Patrirone Role presented a rerequest for reasons of insufficient impact on the team's decision making.
The vice-president and chief manager of the College, Jo Sakiks, confirmed this message and informed the club that the club will immediately start searching for new trainers.
"For the last three years, I have been vigorously, enthusiastically and purposeful of his duties as the chief coach and the Vice-President of the Colorthol Hockey Operator.
During this summer, I have thought a great deal of thinking about how I could improve the performance of the team in order to allow it to produce the results it needs and to achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the main coaches and the hokesperson's vision of the vicinity of operations must coincide with the organisation's vision.
He should also be able to influence the decisions relating to team performance.
These conditions have now not been met.
The statement agreed by Row on 23 May 2013 thanks to Role for his contribution to the team.
It says that Patrian informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organisation and wish him all the best for the future.
In his first season with Avalanche's team in 2013-2014, Role was found to be the best coacher of the League and received the Prize of Jose Adamsa.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but the color-force of the hungry game in the first round was carried out by Colorado Hockeyists.
The Avalanche concluded the 2015-2016 season with the outcome of 39-39-4 and left five points behind Wild's teams without gaining the second special invitation from the organisers of the West Conference.
In his career, Role waged four Stenlium fighting, two with the Montreal Canadds and two with Avalanche.
North Sea oil platforms are opening negotiations and opening up strike
Job strike on the remuneration of workers in the North Sea for the North Sea's oil platforms has been deferred as both parties in the dispute resumed negotiations, the heads of the negotiators.
Wood of the petroleum company Wood Group is striking on the North Sea oil platforms in which the Royal Dutch Shell works.
The joint statement says that Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to resume talks on resolving the dispute.
Over the next few weeks, we have had a number of day meetings to start at the beginning of next week with the aim of reconsidering the issues of concern.
Trade unions said that their recent events organised by the more 25 years of breaks are targeted at 30 percent of the planned salary.
Due to the negative pressures of the market, the Wood Group this year reduced salaries in the North Sea for 9 percent.
As early as 2014, the company reduced salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
It explains that additional wage cuts would allow companies to survive the market recession.
Shell has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to phase out oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in the run-up to large-scale mergers with the 'BG Group' of energy companies.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the glaring oil prices, and the situation is even more complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish MEP, Deiva's MEP, met representatives of the working people to discuss one of the most important issues of the North Sea Action Plan.
He said North Sea is vitally important to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and state in general need an economy that would benefit everyone, not individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects target nearly 1.4 billion dollars compared to USD 7 billion, which has been invested over the last five years.
Keplers size the speed of the stars on the Pledge's stars.
The most recent Television telescopt mission has helped asronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of the stars in the Pledde stars.
The new data helps asronoms to understand why the star of this star went back at different rates, as well as the way in which the speed of the star turns refers to the development of the planet.
"We hope that, compared to our results with other stars, we will gain more information on the relationship between the history of the star, age and even its solar system," the news release said Luisa Rebula in a news release.
The powder's star is 445 years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star are only beginning to rise, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They shall return to the maximum rate.
With the maximum speed, these growing stars are separating large amounts of stars.
They put a brake on the star with the stars.
With the outdated, the speed of their return is decreasing.
Keplers measure the speed of each star cut by setting the time between the appearance of recognisable stars, such as solar plantations.
The newer stars of the stars show that the higher stars are cheaper than smaller stars.
The bull is comparing the star with the dear, more fertilisers are slower than a small metry.
The bull tells us that the Pledge is expected to be larger and more widespread, and the quicker rotary sites are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Pledge's stars are so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where it is possible to compare the characteristics of the stars with the speed of turns.
It says that the Pledge's stars are helping to build theoretical models for the seizing of stars in both directions, both older and newer stars.
We still have much to learn how, when and why, and why, the speed of the stars and the full process of the process are slowing down.
The Rebull and his colleagues outlined in detail the analysis of the Relled Releration speeds in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journalist.
