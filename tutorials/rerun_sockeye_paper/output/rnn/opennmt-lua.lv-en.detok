A total of 28 years was found in the San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old surge was found, which was recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to go beyond his brother, saying that 'His life finally started to improve'.
The Lord, which was found on Wednesday at the supermarket of Vesthile, was identified as 28 years old in San Francisco, Judge Galicia, as a member of the Office of the Medical Expert of San Francisco.
The San Francisco police said his death was recognised as murder and is currently under investigation.
He said that he had worked in Boston in the past six months before he was in his dream, Son & Daughters San Francisco.
The Son & Daughters representative informs that the message of his death was shocked and shocked by him.
"We are a small team working as a cohesive family and we will miss him very much," he said.
In this difficult time we are thoughts with the French-friends and the family.
The Gale Galicia said at the beginning that the French was stastesteed at the beginning, but recently life has finally improved.
"He won the new habit and met a girl," Luiss said in KGO.
Luiss Galicia says that I do not know who would like to go beyond his younger brother.
He was a good man with a broad heart.
"He was always appalled by his family, preparing a long meal and preparing for lunch," Mr Luiss Galicia said.
He never wanted to get involved in the dispute.
He was a brother who had adapted to others.
"In the light of everything that has gone to the gate in the world, he was like a rough diamonds, which, on a daily basis, wrote," he said.
Anyone with information about what happened is called for the call to the SFPD of 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: call for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade unions to initiate protests on the new treaty.
The UK Medical Association (JMA) is preparing to request the Council to support wider protests in early September.
The JAK believes that ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the agreement proposed in LMA.
The contract was voted by 58% of all members who took part in the vote.
On Twitter, a member of the United Nations Council of Ministers, Eleka McABN, said on Thursday that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and that the contract proposal was rejected.
She said: "Taking this into account, the JAK vote has resulted in the agreement being completely rejected and decided to request new formal discussions to discuss key issues."
In response to the silence of governments, the JUK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council in order to authorise the development of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, new doctors took part in six strikes, including the first time in NHS history.
Mr Johna Johna Malawana, a new doctor of the new doctor in LMA, said after the vote that was rejected by the LMA Treaty.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he was told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary, Dgerem, said that the treaty would be concluded with the mediators of England.
Russia and Turkey: Exempt Alliance?
Street that ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to concur and announce eight months of the war and the end of economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin is congratulating the Turkish leader in St Petersburg, the impression that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However, both broke.
Vladimir Putin looked harder and did not provoke warm emotions, even given his customary resistance.
On the other hand, Mr Erdogan said at least five times that Putin was a "dear friend" of his "dear friends."
I felt the number.
He went on to say that relations with Russia would not only improve the pre-crisis level but will become stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan would behave as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes contradictory feelings.
However, the hypothesis of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he has mentioned in his speech was the sinking of Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
At that time Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara that it was doing a dire in Moscow.
The fragmentation was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring genuine confidence will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, the Russian public position has changed.
For a number of months, police television controlled by government spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it was the Turks who were guilty.
The most serious accusations were that the Erdogan family itself made profits from the illegal oil trade in the Islamic State's controlled part of Syria.
He himself has, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was only held because Putin received the apologies of President Erdoğan.
Russia could see this as a sort of victory.
The benefit of the peace reconciliation is obvious.
Firstly, the Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which they tried to overload.
Numerous terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There is also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused great damage, particularly the ban on charterteria, which, normally every year, ensures the influx of several million Russian tourists into Turkey.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Nowadays, too, Russian fighters and chartertine companies would be relieved when regular flights are restored.
They hope for a holiday on the Mediterranean in the season.
Already this week, national TV plans to lower prices for fruit and vegetables because Turkey's imports of fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper cites, Vedemosons: 'ists of tourists, tomatoes'.
However, there were also other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for its perceived reaction to the coup d'état.
Everything can also be seen with the long-standing negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin's interference, which is happy to make use of Turkey's isolation from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly obtained additional points in Ankara's eye, expressing its support for the elected government after the coup.
Please note that Moscow understands it, because it itself has deep-rooted fears of the regime change country.
The summit, which took place in this luxury boy, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as a analyst, "excluded alliance," two countries that feel excluded from the West, joining forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated, there are still considerable differences of opinion between both countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria where Russia presents itself as a city of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations without wishing to reveal information, both presidents said that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish President has certainly avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus as to how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member of NATO broke the Russian battlefield, the situation has improved because both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Scottish Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
In the future, the IB will have a role to play in the future, he said.
There will be no more than Scotland SKB.
Ross McOsman tells Scotland that the ICB brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions, because eight years ago the bank went bankrupt, and it needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts from the brands strategy have used the IRB brand to protect other consumer brands.
The bank received millions of barcies from international sports sponsors, starting from the 6th anniversary of the Kimblne Ship Champion Champia Championship.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banka will be available to Scottish customers but will not be excluded.
In England and Wales all references of the SKB, outside the headquarters and an official stock exchange, will be replaced by NatWest.
The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland already use a brand of the Ulster Bank.
Also, smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank, will also take place.
The price was interviewed with customers and staff with the InverneshIrish.
He told the BBC Scottish Canal: "The SKB will become our investor brand and work with our staff, because now we are becoming more than a brand bank."
The bank itself became a global brand and the ICC became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our staff will work with their customers below these brands.
The ICC has already announced that it will not continue the "six-pack" sponsorship and involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank because we have long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for their customers," he said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become an excellent bank for our clients and will develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of the customer rather than our own needs, we have obviously made a major difference.
Once again we can revive these brands, so I think that is now the right time.
Ankijs Detors won 3000th victory with the first place in Newcastenz's predecessor
The depositors were in the chamber, averting his 3000th victory twice in the crowd.
On Friday, the Corchum Academy wrote his 3000th victory in the history of Britain with the first place in Newspaper.
He reached it with the second victory in this race, which took place in his native city, with the Predilection coached by John Gosburg.
The four-year-old Italians are the sixth cheque, who has reached the horses of the result.
He has joined Seram Gordonam Ričardus, Dougam Smiter, Lestero Pigota, Peter Ederard and Villius Carson.
Ghayyar, who has previously won a horse Ghayyar, said: "This is something specific.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newcastle because I live here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not Karyal Askota, but a normal Friday evening with 20 000 people.
I feel easier and very grateful.
After victory, the Departments and the Predilection are expected to be applauded.
Two strikes, the champion River Jonnsons and the caretaker 20-fold champion Champion Champion Champions League, said the scoreboards were set by a record of over 4300 victory.
Lesters Pigots, the nineth, won 4493 victory during his career.
The film is one of the best keys in modern times, and it is not surprising that he has made a success that only the only way to achieve.
He is a strong and strong one, but his sense of tactics is separated from other cheques.
He is a fantastic writer, his enthusiasm and the years of hardware attract fantasy for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, in the Horsomas, I said to a port that he had already fought 6 000 victory if not only the weekend and the big race.
However, it is a real pleasure that, for 30 years, the mackets have been regularly won in the United Kingdom.
He is a lucky one, which is perfectly useful in the games in Britain, and he is an excellent cheque.
Mr Detors noted this achievement with its firm mark, a flight flight.
From the finishing wind up to an outward flight, the Frenchijs Deers have been the hallway of British horses for twenty years.
This has been an adventure.
He has won dozens of big slogans, including the famous 1996 Grand Reading, Askit, and survived the crash and disqualification of the aircraft on the use of preparations.
Three years ago he was difficult to return after the six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength, challenging those who questioned him when returning to her best form.
And he could take part in the race for some time now, the nine have said in advance that it would be happy to continue membership at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismiss President Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Chief Executive Officer Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanovs has been coming out of Putin for many years.
A 63 year-old politician has been appointed a Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin declares that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration" without giving reasons.
Instead, Mr Antons Vaino was appointed as his deputy since 2012.
Vaino has been a diplomat for 44 years.
The landscape was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia's capital city in Tallinn, and has subsequently worked in Tokyo and later worked in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's homepage (Russian), later he led the Presidential Protocol and government staff.
After appointment he said: "Thank you for your confidence."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as president in the form of law and control of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanovs wanted to leave his office and recommended Waino as his substitute.
Are they persuaded?
Moscow has embarked on this step.
Sergei Ivanovs is a snow and close to Vladimir Putin's ally and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet Security Service in KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
At the public television session, both men announced that Ivanovs resigned from his own initiative.
But despite the smallest ridiculous ridiculous, rarely such explanations persuade me, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight for power?
Nobody knows that.
But the official statement that a man who was supposed to be a potential president, suddenly wanting to become a leader of Russian environmental policy, is treated with great scepticism.
In the Kremlin's homepage, Ivanovs says Putin is saying: "It is a fact that, in early 2012, I asked me to entrust this difficult office, even to say, to a problematic post for four years.
I think I have worked for four years and eight months.
Ivanovs took office in December 2011.
He was previously the Minister for the Interior and Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former staff of the National Security Service, like Putin.
At the end of the 1990s Putin was led by Ivanov, the Federal Ministry of Security, which is the successor of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov.
When Putin came to power he called Ivanovs to five people who trust the most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was seen as a potential candidate for President of Russia, as Putin's re-election to a third term would be anticonstitutional.
At the time, however, the President became another close partner of Putin - Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became Prime Minister after three and a half years ago.
Forced fish in a garden in the garden in Banfa
One husband from Banfa is asking for help to clarify the conditions of species of species appearing in the Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sanctioned by water.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres from the sea, made the fish video video page Perissian, hopeful that someone could know how these five centimetres come into his gardens.
A crowd of wine: bridge is now connected with Faife.
Today, 1.35 billion mapping projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers are connected to the northern part of the Kwine's crowd and viaduks, which means that the bridge is now connected with the Faife.
The first of the four intertwined parts is completed, which means that the construction of a bridge is coming to an end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighed at 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support for cables.
Today, 1.35 billion mapping projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Economic Secretary, Keits Braunr, had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to embark on the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Kine-German bridge."
In this project we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only over 30 000 tonnes of cementa and steel are used in the construction of these parts.
Regardless of the huge weight of the bridge and the combination of dimensions, bridges and viadukes, it is an extremely delicate process that requires huge precision.
In general, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the last stage, which will connect the bridge with Rositu today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for displacement.
"First connector is a very important point in the construction of any bridges."
In this fantastic project, the first link is showing the highest level of engineering.
After the last phase of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were forced to connect the northern road link with the land, or viring.
This has been done in the case of the northern rife wave of 700 millimetres of the south.
It was a huge and at the same time a very delicate operation.
It is a great deal, because viaduks is 222 metres long, weighing about 6 000 tonnes and had to spend around 3%.
A delicate, because the rebate in both directions worked with a team was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything was good.
Simona Bailsa is acquiring gold exercises for women.
There are scandals.
There are scandals.
The symbols of Simona Baills are not concerned.
Dynamically slow.
Without effort, exercise is carried out on the beam.
There is no room for manoeuvre.
Absolutely not perfect.
Finally, the Olympic championship.
On Thursday, an American Antholic machine wrote a gold medal, demonstrating the difference between itself and the rest of the world on the Olympic arena.
Her total number, 62,198, was the head of the headquarters of the silver medals and her team's beet of Alia Raismanes and the results of the bronze medals of the Russian sportspeople Alia Mustafina.
On Thursday, Simona Bailsa, the US Maltese, carried out a force for the Grand Mufti of the Grand Mufti of the city in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa was the fourth American in a row that won the Champion title and the fifth best player, gradually strengthening the reputation as best in the history of its generation and possibly in the best exercise of force.
When the end result was announced she went out in assists because the long road to this was over.
This achievement is taking their place alongside unbridled sportsmen like Maiki Felps, who raised his sport at another level.
Bailsa has been dominated by his sport over the last three years, with 15 medals in the world's championships, with a team of 10 gold medals, in which the 2014 Olympic championship, Los Retone, called her "best vinter," he said.
In Brazil, they expected the last test, where she had to compete to a large extent with expectations that have been put on him, not with the other athletes.
She was disappointed if she returned to his home in Sprais, the Texte without gold medes.
In the midst of the US Championship Simona Baismane, the winner of the witchen and silver championship in the Charlemagne Youth Olympics in the summer of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first golden medals took place on Tuesday, making special random coordinator Marta Karolji rear.
Although Bailsa claims that in its long journey to the massacre, there was nothing waiting for it, but it is not true.
Part of her campaign for the free movement, which includes her special acrobulal transition, is accompanied by the Latin musical changeover, which would be excellent on the streets alongside the Rio Olympics.
This is not coincidence.
The girl who was recruited by her grandparents when she was still a baby, who was exposed to the Eimia Eimia's boy in the Eimard of Eimia, where Battmanes ternes took place, has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost a multi-battle race since summer 2013 and a series of victory can continue as long as Bailsa wants.
Although Mustafina two rounds were under the leadership of a little, it was only a illusion.
The grey and free movement - the part of the competition, where Bailds will defend the title of his championship - is still before.
She brought the result to 15.433 on the Bass and strengthened the leadership with the result of 15.933 free movements
Raismane was very silent while they were waiting for a result that was only a formality and his thoughts go to the bottom when the dream she had previously recorded in his remarks.
The result of Raismanes was a small remembrance for four years of events, when she separated the third place with Mustafinu, but lost the fight for a bronze medale.
This time, the meteine of 22 years old, which the Americans call 'grandmother', raised convincing leadership.
After the release of the service, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to put an end to the aircraft.
Meanwhile, there is already a completely different feature of the 19 year old Bailts Twitter Twitter Twitter.
A 6 year old, Mahai Brauns, was shot dead in the Fiiladelphia.
The police said that 6 years old had been shot in the Filadelphia, saying that this was already the second sixteenth year that was shot in the Filadelphia this week.
The CBS Filadelphia news channel confirmed that it was Mahai Brauns.
The parents said that Brauns were shocked several times, including in the compartment, in the leg, in the roin and in the storm, but there was still a conscious when he was on hospital.
His grandmother Melendeza telendeza telled television: "His little body was simply cold."
I cannot believe that.
The nail was placed in hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family informs that he will certainly recover.
He had to start moving first in the first class of local school.
It is one of four people who were shot in the town of Jermansk.
Three men were also shot: two men in the age of 29 and one 32 years old.
Caral CBS Filadelphia reports that one of the 29 years old men is in critical condition, while the remaining two victims are stable.
The train is telling us that the child was found in the front seat of the machinery in a critical condition of the 40-year-old victim.
The other two victims were not in the machinery and the police were investigating whether anyone had been attacked.
He said that a number of shoes were involved in the attack.
Proper cartridges belonging to different weapons were found instead.
It seems that it has been a long shoot.
There was a shell on both sides of the pedestrians.
"It seems that there were several armed massacres here, who were actively involved in the fire," Gindalis said.
Some homes and cars were also damaged.
Nobody has yet been detained and the police are reported to check the records of observer forces.
At the end of the game, the love hit a 6-year-old girl in the hands of a 6-year-old girl, while she played his place in the area of Vestouklein.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprits.
Why do we need Simona, Gaby and Lauria?
I call this the year of the Year of Academy of Women for several reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the Olympic Games since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three easy paths, Simona Bailsa, Gaby Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza, inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that the team also belongs to Alija Raismane, who is Jewish and Medisona Kociana, which is Catholic.
Finally, this team is truly representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of the black and Latin American sportsmen in this sport.
For the last four years, the best exercise is the African Orthodox American.
Last year, Simona and Gabon took up paragraphs 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gaby Duglasa became the Olympic champion in surprisings, and the Americans could climb.
The world has now seen unbelievable exercises that have been carried out by triple Bailsa, Duglasa, Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza, with unprecedented, but meist exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American country in a row which has obtained gold medals in the individual multiplier of women.
Her team fighter Alija Raismane obtained silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different.
The symona, Gaby and Lauria entered the Olympic club like Alia and Medisona.
They are the Olympic Fans, as the next Olympic exercises will only be four athletes, and this is the last year of the triumph in Marta Karola.
In fact, the exercise is expensive for sport, mainly in private light clubs, with parents paying for training, premises, travel, formatives, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenditure.
Most of these light clusters are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
These clubs are filing all their training and this is expensive and will continue to invest in easy families.
Eimy Belman, the symbol of the Simman Bail and Megija Hainia, has trained his sportspeople since the two girls started with a lightness.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gaby and Lauria, cheaper exercises.
I founded my light organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is in Hārlebad, and we are offering more than 15 000 young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercises free of charge or at a low price, and we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will find a branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide local young people with the opportunity to find out this excellent form of sport.
The coordination of force, currencies and body coordination is slowly developing, as is the taught of hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combines a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train easy and that is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to the Simona, Aliin, Gaby and Medisona about the demonstration of the "Meel Force" in the gold medals of Olympic Games and to motivate numerous young, diverse girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
The new doctors are planning to expand more strikes following the rejection of Storm Hanta's offer.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreements, reaching agreement on changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association, which was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors in the vote.
In July, Him announced plans to conclude a contract stating that NHS is in precarious situations and further delays will only be detrimental to workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new treaty, which will change the conditions for night changes and weekend to improve working conditions in non-standard hours.
Last night, BMA's new doctor Dr. Eleka Makourta announced that the new doctors still had serious concerns about the proposed treaty, especially that it would deepen the labour crisis and not all doctors on equal terms.
Eight weeks until the first new doctor is signing the new treaty, there is a need for progress, because there is no time left.
The efforts to resolve the problems in the negotiations have faced the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with full silence.
This has happened in spite of the fact that, last month, James Hant said that his doors were always open.
President Pöttering must take action immediately, stop inaction and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not do that, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
In the last strike at the end of April, more than 13 000 outward operations and 100 000 visits were suspended while nurses and consultants were trying to replace doctors who had gone in pictures.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the disagreements, reaching agreement on changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the rate of work weekly to 54 000 new doctors subject to new contracts.
NHS employment chief, Danieel Mortimers, called for new doctors to go to strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything but only increase pressure on loved workers and worry, cause stress and impediment to patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have spoken with the new doctor Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions of custody and reporting.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as deployment of workers, flexible training, recognition of training programmes, studies of training and gender pay inequalities in medicine - shows that employers, England's health education institutes and the Health Ministry are seriously keen to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products per day can reduce the risk of heart.
Thousands of patients who have been in heart could treat medicinal products for 2 mnacius day, as the official representatives say they use more people and longer periods.
Convergence drugs reduce Ticagrelor a repetition of a recurring risk to people with hearthons.
These medicines are already being prescribed for 12 months after heart, reducing the risk of repetition.
In NHS, it is NICE's comment to use this preparations for 4 years after heart, to further reduce the burden of heart for people with cardiovascular problems.
At the moment, however, NICE is currently responsible for the NICE, for 4 years after its heart, to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Every year, around 140 000 people experience a heart of heart in England and a quarter of them experience a repeat of heart or insult.
Sulphur and insult are caused by the accumulation of fatal fats in heart voices.
If the scanning is down, it could create a thrombin, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing heart.
However, if the thrombs were released from blood walls, it could go further into blood and block blood access to the brain, causing infumph.
People who have had a heart are exposed to a greater risk of recurring.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and traded by Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombin development.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, give people the use of 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months and another 3 years of 60 mg on a daily basis with the Hospine.
Professor Kerola Longsona, Director of NICE Health Technology, explains: "In spite of the fact that there are medicines available to convey a repetition, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart experience another heart or insult, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of a repeated heart can have a negative impact on the quality of life of the people.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor combined with aspirine is effectively reducing the risk of repeated congested and infumt risks for people who have already experienced it.
With the pretext of treating Ticagrelor, we are happy that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who are thus winners.
In view of the limited information on Ticagrelative or efficiency and security, in particular the risk of bloody use used for more than three years, the draft guidelines will not comment on it for longer than that period.
The culture of polyauthenticity encourages fraud during electoral elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurr Rahman, Mayor of the former Slovenerlex city, was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Hosley criticises police, electoral supervisors and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud during the electoral process because "the fear is to attack ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become a leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that, for religious reasons, the police should be allowed to deploy guards to election stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should show a person's identity when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters must only mention the name and address.
He also recommended that the purchase of voters with special tinies should be used to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs also need to ensure greater protection, says Sir James.
He believes that the press should provide more access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Dauningsk following a scandal in connection with the urban elections in the city.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to cancel the mayors of Lutfuru Rahman from the city, due to corruption in corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 'cynically missed the religious view of his Muslim communities and silence their critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign, which says that a credible Muslim religious duty is to vote for her."
Some 300 votes were falsified or questionable, as one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks said that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly worrying to vote in favour of a post where the senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir thinks suggested a series of measures to improve the election system, including the presentation of a person's identity document to ascertain identity.
His report says: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the elderly candidates selected for the elderly, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan's communities."
"There are fears that the institutions do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be touched."
Sir Aysley outlined 50 recommendations as to how to improve the electoral system, including a ban on political activists to work on a correspondence in order to prevent 'votes'.
The report, which is being examined by Terthea Meja, also calls for a more thorough inspection of registration in order to prevent the use of voters in the area of fraud and allowances fraud.
To consider the possibility of requiring the electorate to present a identity document before voting.
The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Systematic checks are checked to ensure that the person is entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic voting by post.

"It's over, she went out out of the race that it went out and stopped as a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year old Chinese Foysin Ai Yanhana was 1: 57.79, which is 1 661 seconds more slowly than the result of the Chancellor Teilores Rucka, allowing the Canadian to reach China.
The viewers throughout Canada were immediately reacting on the internet because it was shocked, hearing such tone and expressions.
The Emeta Makfarlain writed Twitter: 'Is the direct comment by the CBC just said that the 14-year-old grey from China ended as a pig?'?
Idiod said they were still in the strain.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m was named in a free style in the finest woman of the "small four-year-olds from China who do not stand there."

In the CBC Olympic Games, he said: "I would like to use the moment and apologise for a comment that was announced yesterday after the free race of women."
I refer to the grey performance, not to him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect and I really regret it.
For Prucks, the buyers shook a woman who is unshameless among subtitles.
The offspring was uncomfortable when a woman started to behave in the middle of the column.
In the face of the worsening situation, she went on to see whether they stood up and then disappear, pushing the ball back to the shelves.
She went on to look for the clothing Folkeston Bouverie Place in the shops in the shop shop and had four bikes.
Prucks won Bouverie Place in Folkeston at the centre of trade, where his woman had fled the subtitles and then put it back.
"The man who is not known to be in the shops, who is not familiar with the husband, has been shot dead in the shops.
He said that people were unable to believe their eyes.
Through the middle of the game, his thoughts came from the thumb of the floodgates, shot his wassts and bikes and throw them on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where they were to teach them, she was simply left on the ground.
Everyone looked like his bishops and apparently the woman did not like it because she was simply put back to the shelter.
She said she was not like a shop in one of them.
I did not look to him to worry that someone would see or think about a man who bought his clothes that she had beaten.
He told the House that "there is a great deal to be done," he said.
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
In addition, I assume that, "I assume that the staff after her departure took away these dramas from the shelves, which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that it would be possible to buy a new subcontractor and to learn that the other woman had had them and then not wasted.
Prucks pointed out that Prucks are known about the incident held on Tuesday 9 August.
Concrete thread has been removed from the shelves.
Protecting firearms by means of Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it somewhat safer.
In order to find out how to defend itself in close distance from the attack with the firearm, we talked to Krav Maga Majesty from New York Ronu Mizmine.
Whether you attach you from the front or the left, this video shows how to protect itself and get over the attack.
The mines shall indicate if the attacker is attacked on the verback, then the first step must be reversed to clearly see the attack and avoid the shot trajectory.
Then the weapon must come between his front hand and the shoulder and make a drink in the face with his free elurts.
Then there is a belt with the circus and the attacker burned into a painful way, to take him out, to take up a weapon and to step down and to move on to him.
If the offensive is coming from the predecessor, the situation is similar - we must avoid shot trajectory, look at the weapon and show that the bad thing cannot shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and the whistleblowers must be taken out of the window and, finally, their weapon and relinquishing his father.
How difficult?
You look at the video to see what Mizraci is doing.
But let me remember if you do not know the meistens of Krav Maga, then it is more secure to give the robber his money.
The family of the hands is destroying the social housing of Saltaos Kornvolas and is being put on the street.
The family of the hands has been absent from the residence of terrorising neighbouring terror, causing damage to the social home of 50 000 tonnes.
Tanja Skella and her partner in the third quarter of the Tretacche were held from the property in the Saltate Kornvolg because several complaints were submitted to them.
When they were forced out of property, the shock service representatives found that the property was completely demolished.
There were riots in the wall and the wall, everywhere there were wasted waste and walls were caught with graphics.
The family has now been put out of property and is likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, the owner of the Kornvolon, said that there is a fear that housing will not be restored.
She tells us that people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live.
A number of factors need to be assessed in this case, since there will be no good reputation in the future in the Kornvolg.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
There were three summons and the police say that their terror had been expressed as violence, harassment on the street with beisball clubs, intimidation of the local population, drug abuse, drug trafficking and a loud blessing and layout.
47 years old in Skelan, whose name was property in June punishable against antisocial behaviour.
A number of cleared waste was found in a number of exdemolted houses.
In a house where drug drugs are likely to be sold, a number of guides are also circulated.
Neighbours say they have regularly stood on the streets and are constantly called police.
The Cornvola Hospital Service forced them out of the game when they had 11 weeks to release their homes on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbours were very happy for the deletion because their lives were absolute.
"They don't care other citizens."
We lived for the next 20 years, it has always been crazy.
I wonder how often we have seen the police.
I could not sleep this morning.
We wake up, because there was so little silence here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally left there will be wonderful here.
Addressing Fitzpatriks, the head of the Kornvolas Hospital Confronting Protection, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has been living here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
Domestic gardens were found for different old and non-usable items.
He also said: "It is very disappointing that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because the discard from home is always the last step that the Kornvola Hospital service is."
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour had been very difficult for extremist and neighbours to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that has been invested in this case by all my team, Devon and Kornvolon police and the members of the comfort, who were courageous and cooperated with us, providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
The Fitzpatriks said that all three son had lived here in different periods of time, but everyone was about 20 years old.
Unclean match left on the floor after the deletion.
The service workers will now have to have a waste kitchen that left the house.
In 2014 the police carried out searches and found more than 70 grams of marihuana, importance, accessories and 1700 museum cash.
It only has been recognised as guilty of class B drugs in the storage of drugs intended to spread it.
She said that the money was intended to be a monument to her son, who died in the car accident in 2013.
After the deletion, it has become apparent that they now rent some private property to Plimuta.
Many of the houses were picked up.
Police tells us that they will continue to put tenders who violate their rental agreements.
On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, Ms Gruber said that "this is a clear warning for other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She said that "this is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as want and will not have any consequences."
The police and the Kronvolan police are not acceptable to criminal and anti-social behaviour, and police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Efforts to spend can give an impulse to the economy.

The Cannes Mayor Linge has signed the order that "access to beaches and bathing is prohibited for each one who does not have a bathing water that respects good customs and secularism as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"The penetration of the Ironmales, which shows a great deal of religious fabric at a time when France and culturally is the aim of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of interference (somging, collision, etc.) that is necessary to prevent," said the order.
"We are talking not about the ban on religious symbols on the beach, but on the lovely clothing that is associated with the trust in the terrorist movements that we are going through with us," said Miguel Portas, head of local utility service.
He added that in Cannes Cannes Cannes had not been seen since 28 July, when the Republican Republican Republican members signed the order and entered into force.

On 26 July two attackers who had seen confidence in the Islamic State were brutally murdered by a priest in the north-west of France.

President, who remained intact: Gustavina Zemgalam, 145.
On Friday 12 August, the second Latvian president Gustav Zemgalis was born in 145 years.
The head of the country was proclaimed to be the first president of Chakens and Prince Ulman, the last president of the Latvian president, who was the first president of the first Latvian president.
Nobody of our statesmen has so strongly defended democracy and the rule of law as the never-ending book of Arnolda Auzla, a book issued ten years ago.
"It is a good thing," said Mr Pöttering, who said that "it is a good thing for us to do that."
Others are always very right.
He lesson such as not, today it could be similar to the Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was something close to the nation," he said.
Modern politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Kārli Ulme as a good leader, but rarely know how bad he was.
The government is the only man to whom he has not been blatant, the General Balodis.
Even if he is lucky and smile, he was hysterical after nature.
"It's the opposite," said Auzla.
Professor Aivars Strange, a professor of University of Latvia and philosophy of the University of Latvia, agrees with Mr Ahfi's assessment of the slowness of a peaceful and balanced statesman.
He also notes that the Malgalse was disposed of with respect for minorities, inviting Jewish representatives to the president of President.
"At that time it was not normal, after the German Presidency's Alberta Ktter took over this tradition," he said.
He was a silent and balanced man who had to talk to him for a long time.
He himself did not aspire, simply not to wet.
He was also quite critical, because he did not know French, but thought he had to be able to understand it.
"In the course of the Presidency, the French language was taught," Stranga said.
The head did not have resisted the candidacy, he did not like it.
In all respects he is very respectful of Latvia's history before he was in a serious position before he was in a serious position - he was very demanding.
The Earth was also led by the famous Earth in Suvorova on 3 September, where the repositories and seller associations were in place, in practical government negotiations in Latvia.
He was always progressive.
It was not a great fan of Ulmaa, but the public did not.
"The private negotiations have sometimes said that they did not have a simplistic operation," Strange said.
We lived peacefully, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How do the earth remember today?
It is a pity, but a large part of him associates himself with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, the views were central.
"There was no great shock in his time, that is, he could be associated with a real stable Presidency," Strange restored.
The Latvian State visit in Sweden, from 1927 to 1930, took place in Sweden, which led Latvia to indirectly recognise its full recognition in neighbouring countries and to the family of northern European democratic nations.
A country visit in Stockholm was held on 28 May 1929 in Zemgale.
On 29 June 1929, Swedish troops Gustava V took office in Latvia.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871 in 1871, but was long overdue in January 1939.
Simply ways to help the child cope with anger.
I often have to deal with the fact that the anger of the child, the disappearance of the nightmare, is regarded as something wrong and absent.
When the child reveals his anger openly - we do not know how to respond, 'Econet' says the psychology Jesaterina Kesa.
Specialist encourages a small negotiation of such natural and human feelings, the anger and the nightmare that are occurring periodically.
Congress - it is already a physical activity directed against other people, and it is usually seen as angry.
When we adults are angry, worry, we know what is happening with us and how to deal with it.
We can do our anger and nightmare: say, suppress, stop the strange, show cigarettes (that is not the best way of dispersing anger), let us go down and go down the bed and do another things that are usually not done.
We do not take our aggression against others because we know the different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are looking anger, do not understand what they are doing and how they can live with them.
They can say 'Ej out,' you're a fool ',' Do not see you ',' I see you with you '- and very rarely when you can say' I am angry '.
Children live in literally, they are fully present here, at this moment, they are spontaneously and truly displayed, and often are in different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not ban the use of feelings of feelings, including anger, disgraceful, but rather the opposite, of parents.
Do we have to have the relationship?
The day of a long working day, where everything has not happened as you would like or simply a bad feeling, is so many reasons why I would like to see the 'keys' in the whole world for a moment, day or even longer.
Can it be a long time for relations and a little breathing?
Or, however, does it show that each of the partners is at the forefront?
There are expressions of views among the various ages.
Jānis (23) is short and concise: 'I think that if you have to visit the relationship, you are not with the real people'.
Meanwhile, the Eduards (30) have discovered a scheme that may help anyone.
If you feel that the partner is beginning to go to the nerve for every small detail, then it is a moment when we should study other hunting fields to understand whether you are lacking, or in particular, whether or not they will not see him anymore.
So the answer is: yes, retaining the passport can save time and understand how important you are in the other half.
The Herspars (29) reveals its theory.
In my opinion, the relationship must be accompanied by one another day, because if we spend time with people 24 hours a week, seven days a week, disputes are inevitable.
It is due to the fact that I am going to know each detail that the other is doing, and it is starting to fall on nerves.
People are beginning to flee each other, especially when they are not even talking about what you have done on the day.
My personal experience leads to this, so I have not stood up for more than a couple of months.
If you think at some point that somebody else or another is better, why is this woman who, together, deserves to think that there is not enough good and behind the mountains?
Things alone have little duty.
If not, there is no.
"I have, I have to condemn those who do not have."
The doctor (33) is a completely opposite opinion.
It seems to me that there is a time for breathing.
I can't see every minute, all the time, from morning to night to watch each other in the eyes of the love of the love.
Come on.
There are so many things - friends, work, white.
Everyone has its time.
Of course, friendship or wife, but if both can keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can survive up to the grad.
It is not.
The tip (27) says: 'hard to say - whether necessary or not, may not be taken into account, but one thing is clear: it is one thing that is clear: it is not something that is lacking. "
If this issue is put out, it must be assumed that there will be any change in the near future, whether it is good or bad, depending on itself.
I think, while there is a new and crazy, it was necessary to have everything in the meantime, but when everything remains serious and the relationship takes place in a completely different phase, there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend all life together!
"If you are not able to stand by one another and every time there needs to be a drink, then what will happen when you are retired, who comment on the gardage wheat and the dispute about where the day is better built," said Kristaps (19).
All the words have been changed.
With his enthusiasm and enthusiasm, Rozensen was first wake-up with the interest of the latiest of the Jews.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latin People's first love, which will remain intolerable as it will remain," said Romane Suta, the Latvian oldest magazine.
Also in 2016, the first love of the Latvian art first love was discovered by the large reward exhibition of the Latvian National art museum in the main building.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but it is available on 13 August and will be available until 30 October.
The Latvian National Artitecture, with extensive retrospections in the newly-open-ended Grand Prix, is honoured by Jani Rozental (1866-1916), a hundred birth-fifty day on the international scene, which is included in the UNESCO day calendar.

The legacy is mainly based on the Latvian National Architect Museum, which strongly representative the main stages of the creative activity of the classical class and the variety of cyanrus, artificial variations and techniques.
Apart from the Actuary Gallena-Kallelas Museum, the Liepaja Museum and Museum Museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukk museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
A four-century atmosphere is revitalized by the presence of photographs, the mobile aphibition is discovered by a separate piece of works with photographs that have been admitted to the film for innovation purposes with its own photograph.

The Riga Free Liberation has put all the recommendations of the VK on the Russian island project.
The Riga free port administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (GCC) project on the development of the project infrastructure in the Russian island of the Russian island, Portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The adoption of the project is scheduled for the next meeting of the Riga Free Cost Management Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the CVs in preparing the documentation required for recommendations, the Riga Free Port Authority led the conclusions of the legal and operational audit of the Riga Free Code, and issued recommendations to improve project management at the next project stage.
Information on implementation of the recommendations is also sent to the VK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Coal Management Authority disagrees with the opinion of the VK on the usefulness of implementing the Russians project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the construction works planned under the project are fully completed within the agreed deadlines and planned levels.
"In order to prove all those involved in the project, including the EC, the VK and also the moderates, the main objective of the free ports is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the CSC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues," the head of the Russian island project Sanita Caire said.
The long-term operational plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project has been complemented by the most important actions and necessary decisions of the parties, the definitions of meetings and regular reporting, the plans for the planning of the construction process, and the definition of key border points.
The agreed Action Plan for the purpose of the project by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the ERC, complements the monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the checks on other parties involved in the project from the Riga Free Deport.
The project's management of project management and the reduction of potential risks have been reproduced by the project management plan, defining the areas of the project's management and identifying the documents that have been developed to ensure the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
The project capacity building shall be made up of a project management structure reflecting the structure of the planned project management team, the qualifications and functions of staff.
In order to improve Riga Free Coal Management Communication with stakeholders, a project stakeholder communication plan has been drawn up which sets out the principles, types and periodicity of the exchange of information for the successful completion of the project, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan.
However, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, further consideration should be given to the need for the conclusion of contractual contracts or procurement, and the rule of law.
Under the project, the port infrastructure in Russia has been built on the Russian island, four new deep-water traps, railway cover, and engineering communications.
The construction structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into service at the end of the last year, with an estimated savings of €10.6 million.

German researchers are discussing the number of 'victims of the Berlin Wall'.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities in communist miles could be much higher than was previously the case, but doubts about the actual number of victims are still missing.
According to the data released on Wednesday, Checkpoint Checkpoint, the Berlin Wall of Berlin, has murdered 1841 people in the border from 1945 to 1989 and has been murdered by the Communist authorities of the West Bank, who tried to get out of their territory.
The museum of border deaths has been studied for years and is being corrected by the number of victims every time.
This year, another 11 deaths, including among victims, include a six-year-old boy which drowned, the family trying to enter West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The victims of the new Berlin Wall are also the desperators of the Soviet army.
"The final damage caused by the double evil of Communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," said Alexander Hildebrana.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of people who died in trying to escape from a Communist controlled country would be serviced and disappeared," said Hildebrana.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"Numbers 1841 are unconvincing," Süddeutsche Zeitung, a newspaper of the Berlin Free University of East Germany, said in an interview.
He, along with other researchers of Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far only 260 cases have been approved by them.
Previously, researchers estimate that 138 people murdered only the Berlin Wall.
In view of the fact that people who died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or arrive in the West through the neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However, it does not go far less than 1841.
One of the causes of the number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also listed all the suicide cases of East German border guards, whether they were directly linked to their services.
In addition, there is a number of deaths, which are not linked to direct violence.
"If the old age of between 70 and 80, after the fall in border controls, died from heart, it must have the consequences of this" murderous border, "he said.
However, it is convinced that the distinction between the old people who may have died as a result of the circumvention of their experience and those whose death caused a lasting waiting at a time at the border is certain.
Regardless of the victims' records, there is no easy light because the Communist East German authorities failed to accumulate such statistics, and researchers have to be given papers in different archives in the different archives.
However, the Schtese Group recently launched new documents and, in the near future, it could come up with an estimate of the number of victims.
LPF President Pone to Rio with Training Accreditation - it is surprising.
In the last few days, President Kaspars Pone in the Olympic Games has come to the Olympic Games in the Olympic Games.
Ahead of the Olympic Headman Gakubovska coach, Gary Jakubovska said that the last minute in Rio was the first time that the train had to stay at home.
Estimates in Oona Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins were initially approved at the initial list, with training for Jakubovsky and Delias Colinle and President Pone.
The Latvian Pelling Federation has been named five participants in the Olympic Games and, even before departure, Aldon Vrublevvskis said that Germans will be and he is looking for a ticket.
"Obviously, for objective reasons he was not," Pone said, suggesting that it had not influenced the outcome of the Ribakoh.
After a federation, Uvja took her to help her.
Mr Pone, who himself is a member of the Executive Committee of the LC executive committee, has strongly criticised the operation of LOC, which led to the monitoring of the organisation of the Olympic Games.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons in the Executive Committee of VK and one of them is not to be put.
"I don't know why there was no place for the Pelling federation," Pone said that the company did not assess the work of federations and their presidents, reminding that the president of federations did not receive salaries.
He also criticised the International Water Forum (FINA) before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov had not been confirmed by the participants.
I was not able to tell why he was in the Olympic Games with the train accreditation, which was most likely to be attributed to Jakubovsky.
"Be has been made as a federalist president (" team leader ") but I am not going to have a train accreditation and now nowhere in the home.
The situation changed every day, the number of accredited accreditation changed.
Until the last moment, I think Germans had no information.
According to LETA, a couple of days before the Ribakow had had a conversation with the assists and his grey, the President of LPF said that he had had a daily conversation with the desire to hold sportsmen before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five types of sport that are in the Olympic programme and four of them are in Latvia as well.
The President of the Federation said that it was very important to have drowning issues in Latvia, and that he had talked about programmes in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federations and said that in 2018 the World Cup would be able to deal with.
There is not my leave in Rio de Janeiro, I am working here, spending my time and trying to carry out four programmes.

Every year, the production of juvenile and dry fish is undergoing scientific based species and quantified figures in Daugav and its basin water.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugab and its basin water facilities in accordance with the legislation shall be carried out on the basis of the expertise of the loss of expertise and the conclusion of the compensation measures to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
The national environmental service, on the basis of that expertise, decides on the level and nature of compensation.
The total annual compensation amount for the recovery programme of fish resources is €1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, we are placing 400 artificial fish doctor in the fifth year of the year in which we are in the middle of Latvia.
Cooperation with association by promoting the natural physics of fish is in addition to the initiative to support the programme of fish stocks within the framework of the programme of rebuilding fish.
The location of artificial spawning ships in water is an important measure contributing to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugab.

The French court rejects the requirement to disrupt shops in the Jarole camp.
The French court dismissed the authorities in Kali to dismantle tens of self-formed shops and restaurants in the Jukle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the hearing held this week in Calais, the authorities said that the country should bind 72 self-sustained shops in which people sell different goods, such as cigarettes and energy beverages, to a handful of 50 cents (40p) and simple meals on some euro restaurants.
In Calais, the prefect office said that these self-imposed companies should be demolished because they form the shadow economy and pay taxes, as well as causing fire and sanitation.
The Committee on Humanitarian Affairs explained that these small businesses are essential because governments and support groups do not meet the needs of the camp in which the number of residents continues to rise.
They also pointed out that self-built shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have created 72 self-propelled shops but that it understands the prefects of Calais.
Judge Francois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely unbiased conditions."
He said that these sites had a peaceful meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places of demolition is the camp's' Jungle Book Kid 'camp, which provides more than 200 free metal day, English and French activities and provides advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult control.

Britain is acquiring the silver regeneration in the fight, when Fiji's country of the Fiji is in the fight with the gold.
The spectacular performance of the British sample ended on Thursday, when the "Deodoro" stadium ended on Thursday, when the "Deodoro" championship was overwhelmingly destroyed by 43: 7.
The Fiji showed a meisty in the management of a bomb in the ball in the ball, in the game, in the game, in the game, in the game of the gold - the first Olympic medals in its history.
The Say was awarded a priceless Award Award - a silver medal that was in the UK's third medals in December - the British league can be proud of its successes in the first Olympic regeneration in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
"We're going to be in the fighters," he said.
But, in any case, Fiji is now in its best shape to win 15 men.
Although little is likely to be the case for Britain, there could be a fact that at least one brighter won a gold medale, a former coach coach coach Ben Rawl, a former England coach from Vimblill.
Britain was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under the guise of Ray, they lost all the games at the regeneration in Adeatre at the regeneration.
This time they lost only one game.
Safe is painful, but growth is astonishing.
In Fiji, masks have been impressive, with British forces being renovated.
It was a breakthrough with a number of buses and the World Church Championships, and the World Wide Championship led to 5: 0 when Osea Colominisau received a first landing.
Jilly Tuwai has also increased the dominance over the right in the last four minutes.
The result 12: 0 and the British team did not even touch the ball.
Mr Mičel did not allow the three points to be made in the León Nakaravave, but it was only a little influenced by the result of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua received a flowing in the right corner, strengthening over Britain to 17: 0.
After the game, Nakarava increased the dominance and had remained more than a minute until the end of the first half.
Mr von Ravévou avoided a few setbacks to the British forces and crossed the line through the points.
The substitution ensured 29: 0.
Fiji has been born to play regeneration in a region-7 masks while the British only learn.
In fact, it is also true.
The UK team made a major change in half a half, breaking the Fiji players' line, a full four minutes, which were good after the first time, while Jos Tuisova, after the fantastic team games, received a few points for Fiji's team.
Denam Norton managed to get points for the British team in the left-leaning line and achieved 36: 7, while the game was lost, while the South Korean salmon fans were fleeing the flags and wasted in tribes.
There can be no miracle attitude in the life of Fiji.
Mata Viliame made the victory of Fiji even more sweetening with another at the end of the game.
In the face of the end of the game, Fiji could start to celebrate, but the British was able to sit in the corner.
In the first half of the day, Japan was in the midst of 20: 5, while the British was over to South Africa, while the two teams were very tough in the street, and the south had lost only a few points.
In the first half of the game, David Brauns made a team under the team but Dens Norton crossed the line in the second half of the game and brought a bumb between the horrific meisters to ensure the victory of the British.
In the end of the game, Markus BAsona, who is an authentic player in the Mubra-15 team of England, secured a team victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The fight against cancer has inspired the victory of Helshadow Glover and Heteri Standing in the winning competitions.
It will be the most emotional part of the gold and it is already a great deal.
From the first to the last storm, Helena Gloveres and Heteres Staningas Gold had a special role in the Lagoz tracks.
Although the boat is only two sportspeople, she spent the voice of Robina Viljamsa, who was inspired by the removal of the second Olympic golden medal in the boat of women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport, which has achieved such success.
They were unquestionably dominated because 39 were not able to win an unprecedented victory for 39.
The two big sportsmen with the bed drove down the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
After each of the gold in the cold, there is a team that works hard to improve their performance and the major contribution to their success was the coach who did not know about the day 30 months ago, because he was found to be cancer.
After he said, it disappeared as quickly as it was.
I had an anti-inspiring cancer, one of those who can be operational and what happened.
If they did not do it, they spread to the whole body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It has slightly changed its vision.
Life cancer was detected in December 2013.
This trio said that Vilk could have started the recovery procedure at the start of 2014, and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum if it can be said.
I had a need for income, which is why I have to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in hospital and I went to 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, although the doctor said it would be enough for some steps.
All this started.
Airline itself is a challenge, but this time it was even more.
After victory, the first thought was about Vilck, who was very disturbed by the whole morning, who spoke about more than usual.
Standing in Afghanistan, the Standing Artillery Union said: "This was an emotional week, but it means a lot of '.
It only confirms how much it means and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years behind Helena and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robina we would have achieved nothing, so a huge thank you, he is the best train in the world.
I cannot imagine a better training or better training.
Helena Glover and Hetere Standing have not lost anything in five years.
The couple reached so huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to get closer, the predominantly high weight of Staningas and Gloveres was too high.
We felt every minute.
Helena denied: "We keep rolling, keep up the wheels."
Increasing focus is indeed important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of throwing record record, but simply to obey and win the slogans and we did it.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the Speaker of the Glover and the Television Center Street Bass.
So far, she simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed around six months to understand that I am the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it took around four minutes.
She said: "It is fantastic."

"Step up to the last" manager of Kolegov VID.
After his speech, Prime Minister Marim Kuucinskim (Union of Greens and Farmers) and the Minister for Finance, Danai Reiznieven-Ozolai, are already "essential" to be appointed by the Prime Minister of the GAD for the post of Kolegov.
Rajevskis is estimated to be "the first big decision" in this government, which can affect their future as a politician, with the approval of Rucinskis and Reiznieven-Ozoia.
If it is now to change the position in the selection of the candidate for the post of chief of the Revenue Service, it will have a negative impact on their immigrant public administration.
On the agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers next week, the issue of the relocation of Kolegova, head of DVD, is on the agenda, according to the government's agenda.
Financial Minister Reizniece-Ozola was steered by the Managing Director of Kolegov, after his service was resigned by Inside Petersburg, and when a tender to the Revenue Service's Director-General ended without the result.
The head of the Revenue Service's office, Dace Pelas, on Thursday 11 August, has allowed Latvian Radio - if she offered a candidate for post - to agree.
The financial minister later recognised that other candidates for the Revenue Service's posts were not yet pending.
National Associations Saeima factory, Raivis Dzintars, also admitted that he was increasingly supportive of Kolegov Revenue.
The potential for reducing the deficit in Spain could not undermine the government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal did not implement sufficient measures to reduce the level of deficit to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
It is estimated that, despite austerity measures, the Portuguese budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5. 1% in Spain.
The European Commission decided, however, not to apply economic sanctions to both countries while setting fiscal targets in the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against these two countries is growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such adverse effects.
Critics also point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, with the starting agreement on uniform rules and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, Germany's Bundesbank president Jenus Veidmanns said that Europe would lose credibility by giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendations and not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States validated the deadline for correcting the deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission is promising to examine progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if they are required.
The initial forecasts indicate that Portugal's target could be achieved at the time and the budget deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that the government of this country, within the framework of the Stability Programme, should implement austerity measures for 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, with a further focus on the control of the costs of the procurement of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year the budget deficit has to be reduced to 4. 6%, to 3. 1% next year and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures must be 0. 5% of GDP every year in the next two years.
In particular, it makes the fact that, for eight months now, Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the formation of a government, and there is an increasing possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections within a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the third elections in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the party leader of the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, whose elections would again get less than 33% of votes.
The socialists have only increased their popularity, while austerity measures in Podemos, or 'Together we can' and 'Ciudadanos', or 'Citizens', have been slightly reduced.
The People's Party wants socialist and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission the draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As the representative of the People's Party Parliamentary factions, Rafael Hernando, if governments set up and parliamentary elections will also be held for the third time, Spain will become the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of Riga Sea is critical.
Fifty years later, the beach has concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found is increasing every year, and most members of bathing sites are responsible for this.
The most polluted bathing sites are in Riga.
The Capital Charter explains that bathing sites are fed every day but to fight against unhealthy visitors.
In addition, wasted waste in the rain can be trapped in water at the time of the ravour, thus greatly damaging its quality.
Apart from Liepaja beache and certain places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This week, the 'My seas' campaign was distributed this week.
With the fifth anniversary of the road along the Riga Sea, activists have concluded that the number of people leaving the population every hundred metres has increased.
Unfortunately, this year, the critical assessment has taken place.
"We can see that this will be the year when the number of waste on beache 100 metres can possibly exceed 200 units," the spokesman Jānis Ulme said.
The Latvian Radio Passations were held in the near beache where the voluntary move along the Riga Sea lake.
This year, there have been activists from various municipal waste and pikic assistants to collect even the light bulbs left in the sea sandles.
The head of the road traveller and the organiser Ulme, Mr Ulme, is directly the citizens.
"The main source is the beach visitors, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, from bags, plastic pieces, which are already at the stage of degradation, no longer can be identified, and smoking, bottles, cork, etc.
There are also bathing sites among the cleanest beaches.
For example, nearly 800 units of waste were collected on average every hundred metres, which is critical.
The organisers of Campaign explain that they will also take smokers on every step and not everywhere or not.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing areas - Daugavinal, yesterday, and the elderly - are, unfortunately, a big and far above the desired target of reducing the number of waste units to 135 entities by 2020," said Environment Minister.
Fighting headquarters on a daily basis, even twice in the summer days, the spokesman Uugis Vidlieskis explained.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is very difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who cite, use alcohol, smoke and do all things that cannot, even the special signs do not work," says Vidylands.
The Middle East therefore calls for a report on polluters to be reported to the police.
It may be called the police, it is safe to refer to these abuses and to fight everyone in this way.
Perhaps there may be new warnings, but as I said, hardly it will change the situation radically.
"As all together, we simply need to turn and be intolerant to such offenders," he said.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as for other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that all 56 bathing water quality has been good at all times and there is no limitation of bathing.
"The last time we take the analysis at the end of August," Normunds Kadik, the senior expert for environmental health, said.
During the dark rainfall, the waste placed on land may be scattered in water.
This, in turn, may affect its quality, indicate the environmental officer.
Rotation in Russian elites continues - Putin's leadership is continuing.
What was the position?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wished to leave his post and will continue to be president's special representative for nature protection, ecology and transport.
When announcing changes, Putin has been working with you for many years and we are working well with you for a number of years.
I am satisfied with how you are fulfilling your duties.
I remember well about not using you in this office of President of the President for more than four years.
I am therefore conscious of your desire to change the scope of the action.
And I hope you will make full use of your knowledge and experience as well.
However, it is highlighted that the administration of the presidential administration is very important and made Ivanovs one of the most powerful people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming presidential elections in Russia next month, it is rumours that this step is linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanovs was also called to be a candidate for Putin's candidacy, so the statement that he wanted to take the post of President of the President on nature protection and transport has raised doubts.
Ivanovs is the chief manager of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanovs has been a beacon and close to the allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his temperature in 191975 where he took note of Putin.
Ivanovs became his deputy later on Monday.
At the end of the first Russian presidential term, Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary General of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, following Putin's accession, the 'Information Security Doctrine' was approved, which, in Russia, provided for the revival of national censorship mechanisms.
In 2005, Sergei Ivanov became Minister of Defence of Russia, but was already responsible for the development of the Russian defence industry and arms exports in 2005.
Now, following the resignation of the presidential administration, Ivanovs will also remain in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President of the presidential administration, Mr Vaino, will also work.
The picture comes from the family council in the elite.
Ivanovs was appointed President of the Presidential Administration.
We have been familiar with Antonu Eduardovites for a long time.
Just for the time when you worked in government.
And for the last five years we have been in touch on practically every day.
"I am sure that, after all professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The perpetrators come from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karls took senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, its first Secretary of State.
The "Medhunt" of the Internet is a reference to the "self-determination and independence of Estonia," said Carne Vaino, who asked Moscow to persuade Russia to use force against demonstrators.
He had received a refusal and lost his post shortly.
In short, the landscape has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino is the International Institute of International Relations and manned the Japanese language.
However, he has left a diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
It has already been said that the last unpopular Russia has shaken the dismissal and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the Governor of several areas and federal representatives.
According to pollinators, President Vladimir Putin replaces the ruling elite before the forthcoming elections in 2018.
One of the key features is the increasingly frequent role played by leadership bodies.
Yesterday, Shariforenko is losing the first battle in the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the fight and Latvia has closed its participation in the Olympic Games to the finger of 17.
Trenker Oleg Basg told Latvian Television that the hope was very little and that it had already been clear before competition.
He said that the crowd had pulled in the fighting.
It is remarkable that, in order to get the Olympic road signs, the Nizifoforenko had to start in another weight category than is the case: the weight category to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani fighter was about 25 kilograms.
In the fight, Jevgey Borodavko has been on the verge of two and a half minutes in the fight against the Rjunovko in the fight against the Rjunovko.
As a result, Latvia's Cudo competition has concluded.
The officers disappeared in Rio.
Mr Yvdavko was inaugurated on Thursday.
Yes, he had a more tired opponent, but ambitious times are sometimes surprising.
He did not.
The task of Newspaper Newspaper was even more difficult, as the experience of less and opponents will also be respected.
The result was similar, even though he held a minute and a half minutes more than Borodavko.
Regrettably, in recent times, the Latvian mysteralists are not most ambitious in ambition.
Gunry Score, who has died in Latvia since 1999, has been leaving the Golden Score from Latvia's side of the federation.
Mr Jacankevich, who is advising the Kazakh Kazakians here, and the Vsevolt Zoony will not see his heirs.
But if we don't grow, it will not.
And it is a prerogative of federations.
This is why the promise of the President of Latvia, the president of the Latvian Federation, in Rio de Launamcan, was the promise of the President of Latvia.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening, Evane / Pee Solbery was waiting for the beaches of the beaches in Samoilovs / Shardsman.
In the 'death' group, the losers have ended the game.
The Latvian duplicate was a small derogation, but no more than four points in two seeds.
The stretch of the previous game was growing.
Nobody wanted to die - the feeling above the coin had the entire mad.
The wind broke out for players in the game.
At the beginning, it seemed to be a more comprehensive - ally - one.
But they did not.
The Latvian duplicate game was quite simple here.
It is like Samoilovas and waiting when he will burst.
With Canada plunged, Cuba plunged at the end of the first year and at the start of the third, because the load was not on the ground.
The gentleman was able to catch at that time because it was not enough, but when it was, he was honoured.
Park Samoilovs, with Schven, could win two faces, because the first took over the management with 16: 15, but 16 also remained, exhausted a limit of lost points.
But there could also be 0: 2, because the second half of the last year was 4-4, but, thanks to the wind, we managed to win victory.
The third has already passed the Evane Cancer.
There was an unconvincing approach, the second game is often far too close to the network and Samoilovis left very little to fruition.
If he was a man who has been in the grip of Samoilovs, he was working better this time and only to remove his loss.
The Kremlin was wrong too, and it was symbolic that he was hit directly in the last bomb block.
There was a team.
There was also a lack of success: in the third half of the year, only two Evanine attacks have been attacked near a corta, but the ball was still in line.
Two eans were close to the line.
The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
In the first two games, Evane painted with the serter, and it was very productive against ours.
Everything was set up on the tack.
Now the causes of failure must be analysed peacefully.
Perhaps it was a lot to live beside the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It was two and a half hours.
Short self-confidence was perhaps given a series of seven-semi-fighters.
Maybe it was not necessary to play in King, but to get here and to be better placed here.
Perhaps it was a mistake to find the superior of the sportform.
So far, more than answers.
Our chambers ended.
The dream of the medals.
What's next?
There are still some of the World Cup Turns and also the Jurmala Masters.
Minoilot, with Samoilot, has never been friends and will not be, because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medalles is collapsed, there can also be a idea of divorce, because the blame will be sought not only in the face but also in the partner.
It is not difficult but much harder to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
The two brothers play battles, but Jannis has tried and has already tried, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start the world's superior.
There can be an appeal to Haralde Reglices, Alexander Soloina, Edgar Toys, returning to Mārticians, but it will not be better than this version, which has not been in itself at the World Cup.
They did not smile this time.
All.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that beachmales are becoming more popular, entering new couples, and only a rare growth is less than two metres.
This does not yet guarantee success but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
There is no longer any longer.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to weigh up and choose their games.
The US basketball ranks live on a cruise ship, part of the tennis crash in the Olympic village.
There were also part of the poaching voyage in the hotel code.
This time, journalists have been asked for very modest price prices for the very modest night.
Therefore, the choice was also dropped.
Risks are, because sometimes they may be inconvenienced from a logistical point of view.
This time, the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir, the limits of KoPact and Ipanema.
Putting 200 metres away, bicycle semi-half-hour.
Rajon ganam is safe because the fapast patron's patent, however, must not be lost here.
Vladimir Vladimir Valuuć is not something that was immediately conceived, but the most professional journalist in Russian media Vladimir Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that a dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
In 100 metres and localisation, Laura Ikakeiece-Admidia has remained from his personal record.
But there are already five disciplines.
After 10 years of break the Porgijs and Besa score in Liepaja.
In 1973, Latvia's "Porgijs and Besa" ranked in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised dog has not yet been put on the table.
This is why the organisers of the Cos Art Festival and the Liepajas Easter Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to win George Gelšvina.
"We have great pleasure that, after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy a traineeship in the last time," Porgijs, the great George George, said that the "big engine" in the "big building" chamber, says the concert "Big Projection" leader Baiba Bože.
The Porgijs and Besa, the 'Porgijs and Besa', said the story of love, inspiring, passionate and living tragedies and ordinary day-to-day day-to-day lots.
It reflects American vitality, music and ritism.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this operation that this exclusion of tolerance makes it so lively.
"And yes, it is an extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and really deep way," Sairo said.
What I like most of all is that, when listening or changing this operation, there is always a tendency - the famous megay, the famous motives, the famous motives, but these transitions to the other, the lighting of one person or other identity or the orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this building," the operative leader of Porgijs and Besa, and the rotator, Andris Poga, praised the operative leader of the Porgijs and Besa.
There is consensus among the participants that this is an ambitious event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear the famous Gillšina operation in this world.
It is sound that Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
"Professional," the operator evaluates the visitor Edgars Lama.
The concert was in a special position that the newly-arrived concert scored an orchestra for the first time.
In the name of Mr Jaman Rozentala, the Fish Museum's renovated buildings could be named.
Estonian Chancellor Andris Ameriks, who has discovered the exhibition of the museum, told the House that he could not take the address in the future in the future, but that Mr Valdemle Rozentala was in the future.
Make Memorial, Memorial, said that the reprinting of the address would create a high bureaucratic burden but, overall, the idea was welcomed and therefore agreed with the local proposal.
The Riga City of Riga has put this idea into 19363, creating the Monkarda Dzen monument to Janim Rozentve, who is standing in the museum.
The museum director in Vilhell Purvh was one of the initiators of this monument.
This way, this move could be purely logical.
Throughout my time, I am a little crushed by the conscience, but the Vilhelm Purvine, where we put our name!
"But if you, America, promise to think..." said Lake.
It was said that the National Architect of Arts was officially present in May following an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation door.
The renovation of the CERF culture will begin this week.
A total of around EUR 11 million will be restored for the Velve SIA.
It is planned to renovate several centres, including two spectators, and to adapt buildings to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council is planning to mobilise €six million of funds from the European Union's funds, but the Director of the Riga City department Oleg Buchov recognises that the project is not yet clear for European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to launch the KEF culture of renovation, attracting European structural funds, we are waiting for months, we are waiting for a decision, real action from officials from the Ministry of Finance, it will be money or not," Buchov said.
Last December we told us that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that it would take the decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
Now we see that there is another round of discussion, but we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that Riga City will undoubtedly guarantee that this process will be launched and completed," Buchov said.
As reported, more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Centres collectively organised a reward concert before the renovating buildings immediately.
Although this year, the refurbishment of buildings was still not started and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
The EAGF Cultural Centres of Cities strategy, within the Riga City Department, divided the seemingly independent works of transformation works, where each will ensure the exercise of different standard functions.
First: Increasing access to the CERF culture and upgrading the surrounding area.
It provides for surroundings and engineering and restores the stubborn building.
Second - Improvements in the provision of CE-Care Services.
It plans to improve the revitalisation of buildings, walls and caps of restaurants, watches and trustees, and to clean up the internal engineering of buildings.
Third: Improving the collective working conditions of Creative Vehicles, which includes plans to improve equipment equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the "Light," the legendary rockerel of the 4th anniversary is to be found in Liepaja.
The exhibition will be subject to a different "range of items," photographs completed in line to reflect the activities of the group from the beginning until 2010 when the group is announced.
There will also be the spectacles of the participants, the music instruments, the awards and the concerts, as well as other wider public publications, which reflected the 'circle' of the group.
The exhibition will be supplemented by Liepaja Museum.
The visual presentation of the exhibition is in cooperation with fashion artist and the daughter daughter in the Eldietor.
The musicians who have been associated with the 'Link' group and their relatives have also referred to the call and were divided and memory.
The "Light" is expected in 1972 when the Capaja Award is set up in an ancient Easter Evidence, led by Juris Pavtol.
In the Ansaml, the Lacblila has participated in the festival of Liepaja Prosperity in 1972 and 1974 as well as the town and republic.
In 1966, a fatal meeting took place when Juris Pavtols was picked up by a group of Church and Metalurgs, calling for an Ingrid God, Andris Krumins and Jans Grodity.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been felt for once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some returned.
Above all, however, the desire to show that Latvian romusic is capable of living and existence remains unchanged.
"What I see was lacking: MPs, macks and bardaws, these boys differ from the general evil to propaganotype," the group said in a group's music survey.
In a group without previously mentioned musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Fischer, Modris Raugane, the Aivars Bries, Guntars Muga, Guntars Muley, Guntars Muley, Daini Muga, the Dainis Virve, and many other others.
The release is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from 19 August to 30 October.
On 27 August, Liepaja Ghen will take part in the "Light 2" celebrations.
The first time in 8 months is inflation in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics accounted for 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest rate since 2012 and the first rate above zero since last October, when it was positive (0. 2%).
PCI inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0. 8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016, compared with the previous year, was 101. 9% and average inflation was 1. 0%.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation was at -0. 2% (in July 2016, compared with December 2015) and the annual inflation rate of -0. 2% in July 2016 compared to July 2015.

"It is not time," he said.
The Archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, the Archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, emphasized the fact that if we want to live in life, the message of the Evangel has to be put at the centre.
Because the strength of the truth is greater than the worst of the evil.
A large majority of the European Parliament's website will be awarded to the European Parliament.
What message will the trusts have in this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main God service in Aglona has made an adventure.
Consequently, the main content of the message is also to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that the Cousta route is led by Bishis Buslis.
He, too, will make his own message.
I was the guarantor of the Holy Vehicle Army in the past.
Last year, I looked at the Pope Francian encylicy 'Laucomputer' and updated it in the context of the common home, land theme in Latvia.
This year, of course, I watched what is happening in the world and trying to respond to it.
My approach coincides with the suggestion of church that the message of the grey must be put in the centre of life.
It must be demonstrated that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration to move forward.
Then it talks.
However, in the case of the Channel, in the debate, you said that 'to return to an understanding of a great person'.
What do you understand?
Does this mean that someone has taken out the message of the church?
And is this a return resource for the church today?
In India's capital, the deceased man is raining.
The Indian capital nobody is not going to know about the road to a dead man, it turns out that he went out of the road and that he was still robbed and the BBC has been shut down.
The man identified as a Matium, the man who was identified as a Matium, was working on a daily basis but worked for the guard.
Motifications: 30: 30 of the morning went on the road when they drove a light car.
The survey shows that the driver dropped from the car to look at the victim and then went.
After a hour when no one had known about the bloody man, he robbed a nightmare.
The police and the victim came to hospital for some 90 minutes after the end of the deadlock.
According to the Director General of the National Revenue Service (Revenue Service), Inga Kolegova, head of the National Environmental Service, has served as an associate professor of the University of Social Sciences of the Latvian University of the University of Latvia.
Kolegovas's explanation of the withdrawal of candidatures in relation to the controversial coalition is attributable to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
I said that he was hard to imagine that next week, "Unity" would support Kolegova.
As the "Unity" ministers voted against, while Kolegov was so confirmed, it would lead to government debris.
It also feels that, prior to the announcement of the nomination, Kolegova has been consulted on both the finance ministers of Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mir Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also the 'Unity', which stood firmly against her candidacy.
In the light of the fact that it will be possible to find a suitable candidate with the tender, Sudra said that there were two options: either it will be selected as a compromise figure or the institution as the Director General's duties will continue to lead Dace Pelka.
At the same time, he said, if the financial minister had so far said that there was no other candidature, it is a bullet to the Prison that there should be no tender.
As reported, Kolegova decided to withdraw his candidacy for the Director General of the Revenue Service.
On Tuesday, the government suspended Kolegova as Director General of the College on Tuesday.
Following a decision by the government, Kolegova has shown that it remains ready to become a leader of the Revenue Service.
However, a later thought was changed: on Friday, the Minister for Finance, Danai Reiznieven-Ozoka, indicated that he would withdraw his consent to the Revenue Service's post and that she had no easy choice.
Prime Minister Marjs Kucinskis's press secretary Andrejs Vaivars told LETA that a new competition would be organised by the DHS Director-General.
An accident involving police forces took place in Riga.
This afternoon there has been a road accident in Riga involving a national police car.
The police car, with the closest trucks and light signals, rushed to the top of the highway until Bashir Barona and Dzirnah had a car with another car.
Police explains the circumstances, but initial information shows that the second game is not wasted by police cars.
A woman has suffered in the accident.
Number of people in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year, Riga was 638 784 inhabitants, 0. 34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people officially registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
In terms of population, Latvia's capital capitals ranked between the European Union (EU) national capitals and large cities with more than one million inhabitants.
According to Eurostat data, in Riga, the highest percentage of women is in Riga, the capital of Latvia in the first place between the largest cities of Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three Baltic States, the capitals are the largest percentage of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius, they are 123, and Tallinn 121 for 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be issued to LNMM.
In the coming days, the Latvian National Arrangement (LNMM) will be deployed for warning signs - pictograms, LETA told LETA the Baiba Gaille of the Riga City Department.
There is now a successful end to museum crackdown, which was caused by the operation of euthanasia.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be released.
The people will tell us that the cover is often sick and at time, it must not move on to cars, as well as on bicycles, coaches and cannons.
Ušakov also wrote to the social network on Facebook, who said that no threat to security would cause damage, but "look at it," and the sitborandes will come.
Sularts children and older age: new children's roygrounds.
In this summer's season, the Riga Autonomous Government installed even two new playgrounds in the city, in the Celsian and Chronia, which are now available to children.
The chemical has been installed by a wide, multifunctional royal vessel with different incineration elements, bridges, games, trubs and soats.
The toy is intended for children of all ages.

The media shall reveal the reconstruction of the reconstructed road.
Danish Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the Latvian National Travel (LVC) Administration, and the Kinders, the Resekne-Daugav-Daugav-Daugav-Daugav-Daugaving-Daugaving-Daugaving-Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05 km) was today opened by the government.
The road is a national visit, especially for border routes, so it is particularly gratifying to reveal the reconstruction phase with our southern neighbours.
This is another example that, thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds, the situation on the main motorways of the country is improving.
"According to projections, the funds available for roads during this programming period will be spent in 2018, and we need to think about maintaining the most burdensome roads in very good quality, and also ensuring the mobility of citizens in all Latvian regions without European Union funding," Uldis Augulis said.
The Transport Minister also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable funding for Latvian roads will be presented in the government.
During the construction works from the hunts to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05. km) the SIA Binders started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of renewal is €13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"There is a complete reintroduction of the road design in the reconstruction phase and the next year will be renovated from the whiskey to Daugavpilij," said LVC's head chairman Jouis Lange.
The country's main motorways are hardest hit and until 2018 we are planning to ensure that all the main motorways of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring timely maintenance and the restaurants of asclosures every 7-9 years.
"Of course, there will be adequate funding, and all the trips are looking at the proposals made by expert groups for the road financing system," said Mr Lange.
The project passes through links and lighting at the centre of the media.
Significant land work: in four phases large scale heating and explosion works, the matched road profile, which has so far been very uneven, has been matched.
There are also public transport stops and the re-emergence of a turning area for public transport.
In the past, there were insufficient instincts and temperatures were not transparent due to mountains, as well as the old route of common environmental.
The next building season is expected to restore the road phase from Daugavpils's city to the reconstruction phase (144,80-156,40 km).
This year the LVC plans to work more than 1,100 km of national roads.
All renovations on the national road network this year are available on the LVC website www.enceli..@@
"In order to achieve the results of the desired reduction, the correct choice of food products is very important," the Lithuanian dietary Laura Laura Romeraite-Kolielieth said.
Moreover, it is easy for the summer period when fresh fruit, gas and vegetables are growing our own gardens.
The combination of deliberate nutrition products can help not only to reduce overweight but also to promote the various processes of organism.
The Macaroni and label is a successful combination, because it provides a lasting sense of the salt and helps to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Logistics have shown that the label has a positive influence on the glucose level of blood and helps us to feel encouraging.
Cheap pips and protein rich diets, such as poultry meat or proteins, are not only created by a sense of salt, but also reduce the temptation following large meals in the next few days.
The combination of such a mess is also capable of increasing the amount of burning calories by up to 35%.
The report was adopted with 570 votes in favour, 45 against and 25 abstentions.
Oil is contained in metabolyan nutrient - choline, while paprics are a good source of vitamins C.
With sufficient quantities of nutrients, there can be a reduction in corticol, hence the accumulation of fats around body weights.
The bottles of the bars with fresh ports are yet another paths of paths and fats for broke and lunch, which is worth being included in their food.
Back and ostensibly contain fibre which, according to Canadian scientists' conclusions, is being controlled by a step-by-step hormona, and hence a sense of hungry.
In addition, the ports contain polypholers who are palliative in weight and are prevented from forming fat.
Coal and proteins are also able to do miracles to reduce weight.
This combination can create a sense of salt.
The waves contain water and fibre, and therefore contribute to a sense of salt.
At the same time, protein slows down the digestive process and provides a sense of salt for longer.
We can eat chickens with salts on lunch or prepare protein cocktail from a finished mixture and enjoy it with its favourite vegetables.
There are some products to avoid.
In fruit there are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
With the exception of vegetables, there is polysacide.
The fruits are mechanically split and chemically dissociated up to reach the third or fourth stage of greening processes taking place in the arts.
The link was divided into three different stages starting in the mouth.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat the coin straight away straight away.
When it comes to the mess straight after the meal, it is crossed into the bed with other nuts, where it is not chemically wasted and starts to work.
Do not encourage maize, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers, computer or other carbohydrates, together with other bohydrates, happiness, inheritances, ananquitis, anantants or other acids.
Premirable ptialine in wetlands shall operate only in a alkali environment.
Historic acid is not only hampered by the removal of carbohydrates, but also contributes to their fermentation.
Dry eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs, meat and cheese, meat and milk, eggs and milk, eggs and nuts and milk, and a combination of products rich in protein at the same time.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each of them with different strengths, characteristics and time when they are to come.
Armels, hungry, visual angle and other melons must always be eaten separately from other gates.
The Meles are not being harvested if they are in bed with other foodstuffs.
The men are in combination with protein rich products.
Farmers have a solid combination with solid, but the same cannot be said about fat and protein: fat is hampered by the harvesting of protein.
Protein can be combined with a very small number of fat.
A large quantity of protein products is consumed, avoiding fat use.
It also applies to fresh: it is not advisable to combine a large number of nuts (containing protein) with a whole source of fero (containing fat).
This combination shall prevent an efficient reduction of weight.
How better to work?
"Cooking, thermal treatment leads to significant loss of nutrients - approximately 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of products," the compound said.
In most cases, nutrients are lost to the detriment of food products.
However, the value of nutrition of certain foodstuffs is increasing directly.
After the fluid planting of vegetable grazing is recommended, it is not possible to lose the nutrient that remains in water, and will be able to eat it later.
It is advisable to prepare the washes, including those in vapour.
There is a significant increase in bioavailability in tomatoes containing tomatoes.
In the case of tomato per minute, the number of opopates is increasing by 25%.
The treatment will also significantly increase the availability of betacre bioavailability, which can be found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, the Western Balkans, the sweetball and spare potatoes.
The processing of oils and meat thermal treatment removes the natural characteristics of the proteins present, making it easier to harvest.
Equally, the processing of meat and egg therapies makes the iron and other minerals present in these products easier to absorb.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products may reduce the quantity of vitamins C from 10% to 90%, while the fibre freezing is not affected.
The combination of milk with tomatoes can increase the acceptance of the Iron Curtain in an organism, which in turn provides better brain and muscle activities.
Our organism is taking up to 33% less blood meal, which can be found in plant products such as beans, tablets, cereal products than the bloodbath of animals in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorbing of non-blood iron into an organism using non-blood non-blood iron products, together with vitamins of vitamins, such as inherrers, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood trucks so that our organism can absorb it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of chicken in the production of oxygen in musculoskelets.
To make maximum use of salt, add healthy fat, such as olive or linsee oil.
When you prepare for butter reading, add with the vitamins of vitamins D, the wet grip or the red passes, which is a good source of calm.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbs and plays an important role in the bone formation process.
Alert (as well as other grain products), together with Category C sources, such as strawberries, river, avenues and other fruits or coal, help stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid outlying arteries.
The effects of "Ankara" are criticized for the wire of the winter
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racist.
With this slow effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change the reality and play their own identity on a daily basis as a whole.
You can turn yourself into anantaries, dog or image, which would fit into Roy Lihštenov.
Little is raining, images of images of pictures, which generate more than 30 million converted selfpoints on the day.
Any error is rapidly becoming public.
Snapchat slowly effects have already been criticised in the past, with the accusations that the application is spreading too rigid or metal to skin leather, as an ideal beauty benchmark.
New slow effects have been published this week, allowing users to build their eyes, varied dams and shoes, and some critics called it a racist cartoons of a racist, "yellow."
Similarly, the question was asked whether such contradictions show that the company has more problems with diversity.
The news and public failure started on Wednesday, when the Verge and Motherboard said that slow effects were removed from the application.
The company explained that the goal is to portray Anthy's fathers rather than hot the people of origin.
But those who have experienced racism recalled painful stereotypes.
Other categorically denied the equivalence with Anime.
On the eve of the American Architecture, Greisk Sparapani, Greisk Sparapani, obtained widespread stories in an e-mailbox saying that the slow effect was "insulting and inconvenience to say the least."
She added that it is difficult to look at the obvious parallels between chip cartoons and slow effects.
It shows that the slow effect is not just a soytenn face, but the yellow seemed to be in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has booked into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness from business meetings to Hollywood and devices used in everyday life.
And the audience of young young people who represent different race, unlike the elderly, are more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat is set up to create images that insult users, then nowadays such things do not go unnoticed, "he said in a statement on Thursday.
On Thursday, "Medium" product chief Žou deleted his Snapchat application and recommended others to do likewise.
In his article "Méum," he explained that she believed the problems were due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Žou criticised the company's leadership, which is mainly white men and then concluded its article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so that decisions are taken by some other racial representatives, but they do not take a position in order to be safe and easy to express their opinions," he said.
They also agree with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many people are represented by different race, indicating that this is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its staff, but its representative found that the company has been a staff specialists who will focus on the presence of racial minorities, which are not widely represented and encouraged to enter the company.
"I wonder if we really need more users than we can understand that this is not right," he added.
Congress's Chamber reported that the military officers have missed reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress of the Congress states that the US Central Assembly has missed reports by showing war on the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
The interim report of the Armed Forces Committee, the Committee for the Prevention of Intelligent Armed Forces and Defence Funding, says that their management was controlled by the American authorities in the fight against Islamic State.
Centcom, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampe, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that the intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positive than is actually the case: the facts were regularly misrepresented, showing better progress than the other intelligence analysis.
California's Republican spokesman Kens Calverta tells us: "The behaviour of Centcom is unacceptable: our soldiers are those who are suffering if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors under the highest management of the organisation.
This 10 page report highlights the current problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central Facilitations on American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of Obama's administration would have missed reports, it shows that Centcom's management has put pressure on analysts to show a more optimistic view of the dangers of the Islamic State (known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that, in the first half of 2015, the press release of the Central Governance Press, the announcements and reports Congress depicted the situation significantly in light than was actually the case.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
In his report, Maiks Pompeo, a Republican party representative, said: "A number of months of investigations are clearly demonstrating that."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the main officials of the Central Governance of the United States have missed reports, showing the threat of the ISIS to Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being missed.
On Thursday, the report will take place on Thursday.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence is carrying out an investigation into the activities of Centcom intelligence services.
The Democratic Party members of the Intelligence Regulatory Committee issued their own report on Thursday in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
Internationally, Adams Sharifs, in his report, in 2014, Centcom too restricted the evaluation of reports of intelligence services on the ISIS and Iraq's security forces.
Mr Schifa said that the process "stopped the dissemination of information," aggravated the ethical ethics of analysts and "distributed the truth of the facts."
However, the Shifs and Democratic Party members added that there was no evidence that the White Nam had put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports in accordance with "previously defined or political positions."
The final results of the inquiry were published by Daily Beast Thursday.
In August, the New York Times said that the Pentagon General Inspection had opened an investigation into the complaints of Centcom analysts.
The spotsman for Pentagon, a lieutenant commander, said that Pentagon will not comment on the Congress report until the investigation continues.
He added that experts sometimes interpreted complex data differently and the Ministry of Defence and intelligence are calling for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
Investigations are not only about the question of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement expressed by more and more defence ministries).
But last year's charges call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Management Authority on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism is reminiscent of the state of the Islamic State's intelligence over a decade when Centcom intelligence analysts Gregorium has published a study saying that George W. Bush's administration launched a war in Afghanistan, too little thought about its possible consequences.
They also played a key role in the opening of the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hemicist team had found that, contrary to public reports, air bombings have not significantly worsened the financial situation of terrorist groups, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil onto the black market.
The Times in September reported that this discovery did not come outside Central Governance.
At the moment, the Centcom commander, General Loid Ostins III, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers thought that the war reports were too positive.
In April, General Ostins went to leave and General Jos Votels came to his seat.
In the US, the United States in the hoccup of women in the United States has been able to win the United States in the fourth round.
The day after the victory in Japan, 6: 1, Thursday, Kevin Bama won the first two rounds of the U.S. hockey team, when the Americans supported the Indian team with 3: 0.
"I'm not happy to remember if I had been able to remember that," he said.
She said: "I have no idea.
I am not out of those people who are on the floor.
But she knows that the American Olympic Games are 4: 0, which gives them an opt-out in their group on Thursday, following the victory of Japan on Thursday 2: 0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in order to break the last round game.
The two teams have already qualified a fourth shortlist and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six-team group and which the second.
The first prize will be slightly longer from meeting with a strong sample of the Netherlands, which is the leader of the second group.
The Americans, who have been in the first place in London four years ago, have already taken the last seat between 12 teams, as well as the game of Saturday.
At the same time, the team was also
He was in Bbaswa in his first victory for his first time at 3 year old, with her senior daughter's sister in DRecsell, and the National League joined when she was 16 years old, becoming a random player in history.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because I did not get the finger.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
In the next year, English Kregs Parhull was appointed and everything changed to the better.
They called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
In London we did not invest as much work as now.
We have changed everything.
"We're going to have a breakthrough in the first half of the night.
India started the game without victory in its account, but her sample was very tough and kept a minimum result 0: 1 to the end of the third period when Bama restored.
She took a ball in the centre-side of the centre-right zone and then looked at the middle of the countryside and sent a ball to the American 2. 0.
In the fourth season, Melnis Gonzalesa won even more.
This was the first round of the US Guillermo Square Championship.
She has come.
And also Bama.
"We are going very well now," Pahama said, but as well, it will show the game on Saturday.
Depression periods are the "intelligent metal"
In March 1933, in the run-up to the presidential election, Mikline Delano burned in the oin room to hold the mess.
The President of the President Ragerish had a fine apparatus of the nightmare, such as a gesture actuarial product, or a blow of the fuagre and Merilenque militia.
On the other hand, his metal was far more modest: the polls of eggs, potato potatoes and dessert.
Jiegelmane says: "This is a way of showing solidarity with people who have been very hard."
Her husband said: "This is also a message to the Americans, as should be eaten."
A couple of Brooklyn Heights are overnight historians.
The last book of the CFR described Chinese crafts in America, but Ziegelmane, in his book, "97 cables," a description of "97 Axles" through the Hotel House in Manheten-east.
Their new joint work on the Sami Maltese, published on Tuesday by the Harper, is the story of the American edition of the Great Depression.
To show some solidarity in culturally, they went back to the meals together, "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop," a simple lunch in the Wtirona district and operate from 1929 when the major depression began.
In 54 years old, Ms Ziegelmanme ordered the butter with olive cheese and cemetery olive, while 57 years of coca were ordered by the wood, potato polls and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a fake bag, a couple of people admitted that his choice was very appropriate to talk about the big time of depression.
Mrs Ziegelmanme said that the counterfeit rainfall was very popular.
There was a baby black, a glass, a baby and a baby.
They were prepared from the basic components and other components that enriched the meals.
Think as it is - eating so many glots to be half a day.
Mr Kou was silent.
"It probably seemed to be full of lead," he said.
The Swedish nominee, in particular in rural areas, was the head of the American lunch.
Women were prepared to eat their men, workers and brokers, lunch and dinner, with fresh signs.
At the first World War, the Americans sent Europeans to the eys, the Sami Maltese, describing how the Americans were adapting to circumstances when America suddenly ceased to be a land.
"At that time, the food became the main place of attention of the American people on a daily basis," Mr Kok said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on this issue.
The new budget was just as important: it was not known evil, such as fake gold and indignation, that there was an "excellent way to use the surpluses," Ms Ziegelmanme said, as the likes could hide the unattractive ingredients under the stubborn measurement.
The fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap fruit.
The meat that was the main component of the American malicides for years became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than long, mother, new, yet unprecedented forms.
In a long-standing paper, Ziegelmanes found a recipe for fine-tuned butter.
Mr Kohl added: 'This was not a popular addition to the dinner table'.
Ms Ziegelmanme emphasized: "This was a real game.
The snow is not compatible.
Many homes were subjected to difficult times.
These include household economists as a Luise Stenley, the head of the Federal Habitual Economy Office from 1923 to 1943, determined a country's eating habits, which were not seen before the Great Depression.
In publishing articles and prescriptions in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that households become 'economists' and adopt challenges such as turning the maaroni and the carrot into a long mess.
'Saint Maltet 'is a historic gamble.
Particularly interesting is the testimony of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, for example, President Herbert Haidane's' let me eat 'attitude.
Although he told him about his small childhood and caning in Aiova, he actually served as a fine currency for which he had become.
Mr Kohl tells us: "he was a European kitchen, for example fish with cucumbers."
He woke almost guns on the cold, wearing dinner.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Rugfish would have allowed the same mistake if his wife Eleonora would have advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
"It's a bit of a domestic worker who did not learn to eat," he said.
As soon as the country's economy is restored, the vast majority of depression is disappearing.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional values, as well as how science is used in science, Mrs Ziegelmanme.
It is a long story that, when writing book, they gained greater awareness of the eating habits of Mrs Ziegelmanme, for example, why she was unable to discharge the ear.
"She was really afraid to discard the ear," Mr Kou said.
Mrs Ziegelmanme said: 'She actually struck people'.
There was an incident with wind.
When we were stuck in the Eisenberg eat, the writer would remove the dessert from the sbags from the sbags: the bottles that President Rugeke used to eat lunch.
"This is a spare car," Ms Ziegelmanme said, adding that at the time there was a widespread habit for the modest eating of the ice.
There is no taboo, only dried waves, little miles, sugar, water and sanitation.
Everyone has tapped the war in the villages that were on the plate.
It was not so bad.
Mr Kou will be leaving a few more rubbish.
He told the House that "we're going to have a lot of money," he said.
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C
A judge has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc" is entitled to refund for lawyers' services paid by it in case of Merck & Co Inc from the Hepatitis C patent against pharmaceutical companies.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of 200 million barcipounds in the hands of two Merck patents, which were threatened by the US federal judge, when the US federal judge identified abuses in Merk, such as the metal after the oath transfer and other non-ethical activities.
On Thursday, the US judge, Beta Welsons Füh, said that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal expenses that it had incurred in this case.
Merck is attempting to obtain a position on the market against Gilead, which is dominated by the new generation of Hepatitis C medicines, which are efficient 90% of the cases of start-ups.
The case was launched in 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other by trying to gain ownership of the newly developed active components of sophosphorus, which is the main part of the Gilead medicinal product.
The US forces said that they had fully taken over control over Manbidza's city from the Islamic State.
The forces supported by the US have fully taken over the Manbidian city in the north of the country on the Turkish border and the latest Islamic State soldiers have left the city, the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDS) now paved the way for cities from the last opponents who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2000 hostage civilians who were bought by fighters, the news news agency Reuters told Reuters Darlić's military council from the SDS allies.
"At the moment, the city is in complete control and we are carrying out the search for fighters," he said.
Clinton has reached $10.75 million in 2015 and has paid 34,2 percentage federal tax rates.
Hillary Clinton published the 2015 tax declaration on Friday, showing that the presidential candidate and her husband had earned $10.75 million this year and paid the Federal Tax rate at 34.2 percent respectively.
In 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly in its Clinton charity organisation, while former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million from his book on work in the National Departament published in cooperation with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton electoral ally, US Virginum Senator Kee Keins and his wife Anna Holton published his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a Federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Timi Kevin continue to set new financial transparency standards," Clinton's visit to Jenifera's Palace said in his statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind a variety of pretexts and reservations, so that it does not have to comply with promises to disclose its tax information.
The disclosure of nominal tax information is traceable in US presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
Trump and his lawyer, New York, said the audit of the National Accounting Service as a reason for disclosing tax information.
"He's a march," said Clinton's campaign partner, who said in his Twitter Twitter.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser Michael Kohley told the CNN that he will not allow Trump to disclose tax information before finalising the audit.
Trump's presidential candidate, including the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romny and other Republican Presidency-in-Office said his refusal raises questions about his real property, donations and other business obligations, including commitments with Russia.
Clinton bleached oil fire on Friday by publishing video where a number of influential players ask Trump to publish their tax information.
She returned again to this issue during an economic speech on Thursday, in Michigan.
She told us that "he refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
"Politico" tells us that Trump has paid very little or has not paid taxes at all in the 1990s, and the "New York Times" chief said that many books and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the proposal by a billion dolent Varena Bafeta, to promote the idea that anyone who earns more than 1 million dollars a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, in Omahad, in Naphz, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also present, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Mr Bafets said he was also carrying out an audit of the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton is now living in Clinton, in New York, and in the period 2007-2013, the average Federal Tax rate has been paid at around 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax review shows that unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are wage.
Their main investment was a low cost index fund, from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

Jews of Jewish film criticized hotel in Berlin on the removal of Israel's Israeli military code at a request to the RT
French film maker, French film maker, said that "Kempinski Bristol, a hotel in the hotel in Berlin, is not available to the Israeli telecom code," said Hotel workers.
Klod Lancmans, a director of the Holocaust Shoah, wouldn't close his dissatisfaction with Berlin's Kempinski Bristol, a hotel and an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
In the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find an Israeli military code on the list of hotels.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been massacred and destroyed?
Lancmans.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol is offering the hotel to call the country through its call centre.
The seller requested clarification from the hotel staff.
Lancmans said that he was shocked.
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a deliberate hotel management decision."
The reason for the withdrawal is even more insanded by the film director.
"Most visitors are Arabs and they demanded the extermination of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted an explanation of the Hotel worker.
Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jakovs Had-Handelsman, has called a 'big blow' in this case.
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany is, precisely in this hotel network, even greater humiliation.
Clarifications are not necessary.
"We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event was also quite wide-ranging on the internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel had simply survived Arab customers.
Someone else said the hotel was in the streets of Kurfurstendamm alongside synagaloai.
Der Spiegel said that the hotel had quickly rejected all rebels, saying that it was "misunderstanding" and apologised to Lancmanam.
"We have not received direct orders to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Sudan deutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski.
And note that the code is once again added to the list.
Police is using gubber bullets and rivers against protesters of protesters.
Students and police collisions took place in the city of Sicily in Brazil on Thursday, where students gathered in demonstration against reforming government education systems.
Police used gubber bullets and rivers to students.
The problems began when the Ombudsman tried to kill students, leading to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in demonstrations to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The Governor's Governor, Geraldo Alckmina, intends to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators highlighted the walls of the walls with messages against interim President Maikla Temers.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to support the deducted president, Dilma Rousefai, who voted for a Senate.
Skiner Skiners: First to remove UK gold medes in cycling
Muriner's first club championship at the end of the game was the first time that the British team held the title of his championship.
The 23 year-old sportsmen from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making a proud legalistic of Sers Krisu Hoina and the winner of the favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago Britain received a surprising victory when Holy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medes.
And they also reiterated it in the World Cup in London, although Holy had already finished his career career.
The problems were at the stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as a team of witnesses, Dgeyina Stafu, had to replace.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When he went in, he was trying to fill in China Emadi and Met Krampton.
The British coaches were hoping for the Skiner, seeing the potential he could then prove.

However, the British trio obtained gold medes.
After his blessing, the Keni, the Keni, and Skiners were protected.
A change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindu went through a more carry-over to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skiner to drive faster.
Holy watched the SBC's spokesman for the BBC's spokesman and Spoler, Kenya and Hindesa's eyes at the moment when they started to go on the road.
A 23-year-old glass said: "This was an unspeakable honour."
I do everything to defend my name.
We set the Olympic record and launched the World Cup.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After the victory with Kenya and Holy in the Olympic Games in London in 2012, Hinles will be aware that deliberately fell on the trace after a failed start.
Later, he turned his comments and the British competitors did not play the game.
This time there was no incident.
Hindes said: "The British flags referred to London in the tribes."
Over the last 3 months we have become a frozen team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympic Games was really special.
One piece of medals will be waged a country that won seven of the ten gold medals in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of teamprogress over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of the Holy by obtaining three pieces of Olympic gold medal.
In Kenya, this would mean six winning gold and one silver medal, and Kenya was born on 23 March (see that it is a British holy date, because the day has also been born with a strong Japanese, Mo FaraNeelie and Rodler Banisters).
Holy was born on this date.
Kenya is a sprint for the future, which starts today and will continue next three days.
The 28 year-old sportspeople from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this.
Peace is always the best.
Because it can win together with team members.
If you were honest, you won't win one. "
Hindu said: "If he gets another piece of gold medal, he should be appointed by the military."
On that day it was the only fight for medals, but they were not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlijs Vigins, Eim Klensium, Strait Burks and Oveina Douls showed the highest qualification time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The global record set in London in 2012 is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the finite will take place today in the second half of today, where Vigins will certainly be the focus.
Yesterday, before a qualification, he had a disagreement with the Commissioner when his judges called him to measure his growth.
Eggs Rovsela Shanda, Elinker Barker, Elinora Barkere and Cape Arčibalan, and Cape Archibala, who has been installed for a new record of 4: 13.260, will continue with the Women's Rights Committee.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, wins, will win the medals at the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and non-existent performance in Beijing and London, everyone looks for the same achievements as well.
In the meantime, there has been a variety of events, after accusations of sectarism and dignity, a replacement of the technical director, Sheart Saton, and the career is ending by Holman and Viktorium Bendletone.
However, in the run-up to the first bikes, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Bishop is becoming uncertain as an ambitious treaty is interrupted.
The Aluminium smels and hundreds of workers in Portland have become uncertain, as its main customer, the energy company, announced a suspension of cooperation.
The statement is based on the plans of the Victorian Government to end subsidising energy companies, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20 years of subsidies will be suspended in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 Alcoa Portland plant jobs are at risk.
Both direct and indirect jobs could be threatened at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the melting house consumes around 10 per cent of all the electricity supply.
In 2014, the "Point Henry Henry" was closed in Alcoa, which led to the disruption of the Anglesea power plant.
The Alcoa Portland buckerel is working with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation on the rise of the Australian dollar value and the cost of producing factories.
The industrial energy supplier 'AGL', which delivers energy from its Ly Yang A 'power plant in Latroubes Ieleka, says that the other three owners are likely to cease their contracts.
Most of the power stations are Alcoa and Alumia's joint venture, with the company's share of "CITIC" and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL" looks forward to continuing the activities of the Portland factory, which would mean further energy supply to the battlefield, "
AGL said that contracts were so-called "risk restrictive contracts" to enter into force from November 2016.
The Treaties have a period of 12 months, so they will be valid until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenues from these contracts in 2017, "said the company's representative.
From 2018 onwards, the potential impact of the fiscal year on profit is limited by favourable market forecasts for the future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that the estimated losses of EUR 187 million have already been estimated in its forecasts, with these contracts being interrupted.
Alcoa says that the decision to end contracts will not affect 'Alcoa' opportunities to continue the process of slaughter or supply it for energy.
In 2010, the US company said that it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be interrupted in November, but the company will not explain why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of Portland Circular Church in soltoria and the closure of Tomago factories near Newcastle, the weak economy of the sector.
The Executive Director of AGL Street Mikelson said last week that the analysts in Portland spent 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megagatus energy during the year.
If both factories go out of the energy market, then energy demand would fall considerably.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, and the situation could deteriorate, with the budget decreasing.
Three out of five people in Kine, mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have the means to combat illegal discards are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the reduction in funding will only become worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
He said that the latest Association Report of the Legal Director of the Kineslende legal centre, which is the latest one of the Association of National Accounts for Legal Affairs, is now being denied legal aid to thousands of people in need.
Mistrs said that if this decision was not lifted, the situation would be worse.
He says: "The legal centre of wine is constantly underfunded, it means that aid is refused for thousands of people in need."
People who seek to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are experiencing divorce, workers who are disproportionately dismissed are legal problems for all these people and this report shows that they do not receive the assistance they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, meaning that several thousands of Khartoum people will have to face their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the immediate suspension of funding by the Attorney General and Kineslends Senator, George Brandy, in order to prevent people in need of legal assistance from getting it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to the government of Palazčka to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign appealed to court because someone has disembarked a firearm
New York: Donald Trump has been sentenced to court by Donald Trump as they did not take action with information that they opened a firearm against a worker in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a court charge which was submitted to the Court of Governors on Wednesday, a former campaign coffer.
Bordini said he had waited for months to launch an internal examination of these cases, but it was understood that this would not happen.
The head of the driver, the chief of the game, led his finger on the finger on the meat and opened the rival against Gulta's knee.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaigns, Bordini learned that at least four people have experienced the same.
"It is not up to us to shake up," he said.
Just two days before submitting this file, the Republican party nominee led to a scandal, informing people that the "people of Amendment Amendment", i.e. the owners and enthusiasm of the latter, could act if he wished his rivalry, Hillary Clinton and his elected judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media had broken his words from the context and he has never been inciting violence.
Bordini, with his request, wants to recover compensation from campaigner for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines, on the attack, on the use of the illegal weapon and on the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's representative Houpa did not comment straight away.
The Philippines has failed.
WCCB - The local news agency in Sharlot tells us that the Philippines has recently left the campaign.
It has also failed to call his advisory firm "Innovative Congress services."
Donald Trump, President-designate of the Republican Party, has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition: finishing and sports blessing in the cold.
On Saturday on Saturday, the first time in the Cirville, people crossed the bricks and sports holidays.
After a decade of celebration, it was decided this time that the Her's Sunday will no longer be.
A new page is over.
The day started with sports competition.
This time, the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious because, for example, the horrors had to be met in the guy, the pockets of the people, "bumping," were not at all in the same Olympic Games.
Every participant, however, could show how strong, courageous, successful and attractive he is.
After sports games, all of us gathered a free eating eating, where the gun started.
In the meantime, there was a 'child corner', where small were able to disappear in the hard refunds and to obtain a new image in the sink.
An innovation that could also become a tradition was a driving debt showing both tractors and motorcycles.
The head of the Body of the Body of the Body of the Cogavilvile, Inga Kadywood, who led a nice rest and dry time, but it was still raining, but it did not make much of it.
The stories continued with the winding-up of the most recent people in the KPRs.
It is really good that the pastureland has been completed with five girls and one puk.
"The Golden ritrites, the Ellen rites, the" Rudens jets "and the" Golden Ling "of young people, were very much in the midst of the Senates.
And it's nothing to wake up in the wet.
Of course, the indigenous people and the villages are happy with the famous actyre of the Nazis Jānis Jarang and the Dainis Porganis, who was once again in Mildity, and a clarification of the Crimen, as well as the kidnapped wife from the fishermen 'days'.
The prize was the Bruge.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes the Checks very attractive, just as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work to benefit all regions of the country from the Olympic Games.
There was a great deal of the Olympic Games and the reality.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Hicrope.
The local communities alone will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs, and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the vicinity of Hytear.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be people who will see that this challenge is too high and that the expansion of Church is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain will never succeed in preparing for the Olympic Games and that it will be a global failure.
The Skepticians were wrong for 2012 and, in Chysiz, they will not be right either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Chheap has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project that will benefit the whole society and not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion, creating the soil for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
Heathrow is working an excellent team that has created 11 billion mapping infrastructure for an investment programme, covering the best airport terminal in the world for five years, and finally at the terminal of 2, which is built between two more intensive seals in the world.
They are now prepared to set up a third scrapping, which will be financed through private investment of 16 billion mapping.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success, and I am sure that there will also be the enlargement of Church.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow, ensuring our future trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.

The woman wrote on the big road, trying to suicide.
The nightmare went on to the big night.
The police are trying to find a witness in a case where she passed a series of cars on Thursday morning morning.
The accident took place on Thursday, shortly after midnight, near the corges of the city of Vo canton.
The police report says that desperately wanting to suicide, a woman had lost the road in the dark where several cars went.
In an unintelligible attempt to kill himself, the victims, 49 years old, passed several cars, including heavy machinery.
She died at the scene.
In a number of cases, the drivers involved have already given evidence, but others have not yet clarified, says the police, which calls for the involvement of drivers and the testimonies of the accident.
It has also started a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, a lawyer Gilles Hobrstellers told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
Hofstellers added: 'It will be clear to the public prosecutor'.
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone on the road, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that the pedestrians will be the pedestrians, the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was justified after the kidnappings when she went to a man in August 2014, who slept on the A1 road near the night of the night.
The Court of Justice found that the 22 year old victim had been beaten and later noticed on the road.
The Court concluded that the police officer, on the road to an accident, went in a situation in an appropriate manner and the judge admitted that the man on the road was "completely unpredictable and exceptional."
Anyone who has information on the incident of Thursday from the Morges is called upon to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The Internet collects signatures to organise a new Head of DDA.
Collecting the signatures of Avaaz.org, a new Head of State Accountability Officer (VD) driver's office.
The petition addressed to the National Association (NA) and the Group of the Greens / European Union (Greens) states that the public wants a transparent and professional nomination process.
The petition was set up on 10 August and signed by 55 people.
Director of the Directorate General for the Revenue Service, Inert Kolegova, is untransparent and non-professional.
This recalls the best tradition of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again puts public authorities in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a contest with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the petition text.
Mr Janis said that the Society had not known the criteria for the post of Kolegova.
Nor is it clear what candidates are going to work in the VID.
The article states that a new, open competition should be established for the National Chancellery, which actively addresses professional candidates, personal selection experts and adequate remuneration.
The financial minister Dana Reizniesys-Ozola officially nominated Kolegov VID's post last week, but he was expected to approve him in a new position, but all parties' unity was voted against.
Samoilovs: "If we lost, it was bad.
Mr Schoilovs and Jānis had hoped for the prizes in the Rio Olympics and Janis Schumins had been hoping for the award in the Rio Olympics, but there is no difference in the way in which the competition is to be concluded.
One of the world's strongest beach voywife is in the final and decisive game with 1-2.
Latvian sportspeople received one victory in the three sub-teams, but the ratio was even two.
The number of small points of cross couples has been counted in the following way, which was the most detrimental to Latvia's duplicate after this massacre.
"We were under the leadership, but from 16: 15 it remained to 16 points," Sir said.
I do not even know how the remaining part of the sixth half stays apart.
It must not.
After that, everything was in the second half of the procedure and in a seated gallery it was managed to break the game, and it should also have been a good basis for the third six.
We started in similar terms, but after having changed the parties, the result is only one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the group, all the teams were similar, almost all the masks were three seed, so there were small points.
"We needed to play a more similar game, not to return 3-4 points in a row," he said.
I thought Evane can be restored.
"In the first half of the sixth year, the second tranches were over to 2 points, while the third to 4 were in the game," Sir said.
We tried to show the best game.
They came out of the cold.
The picture was not seen before the mastery, but it was known that as many as possible as possible.
"If you lost, then I'll rotate," Samoilovs said.
It's a good server from Evane, and it was very good for the third and it was difficult to build the attack.
In the meantime, I was very wrong to see the emissions of the Pee, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilovs said that, unlike the previous massacre, the sportsmen were not nervous today.
"We won, we played, protection was too, but better reception was needed," athletes said.
"They played well at the end," he said.
Before the nurse said earlier, the loze was the most convenient.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even from the group.
"All of us were expecting medals, but we are still there, and then there is no difference: 25 place or fourth," Samoilovs said, who predicted that the durability will continue in the future.
I think it will not be and will continue to play together, because this is only one hospital.
He went on to say that in 2008, he was in the middle of the third Olympic Games, as he began in Beijing in 2008, but four years ago in London was playing together with Ruslank Sorokina.
In the meantime, this was the second opening in the Olympics.
"Latvia energego" follows the process of opening up the gas market from potential trader position.
The country's energy company "Latvia energo" follows the process of opening up the gas market, both from the consumer and from the potential trader position, said Ivita Bidere, a company's name secretary.
The House calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that, in the event of a failure to comply with the rules of the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers should be informed of the results of the negotiations.
"So, on my part, we are actively involved in establishing and commenting legislation, and tabling your proposals," Bidner said.
The BNS Agency has already wrote that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Organisation for Public Services, has developed a draft Cabinet of Ministers' provisions on "Natural gas trade and use rules" which will change the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market by ensuring the free choice of natural gas traders by natural gas users from 3 April 2017.
When working on the new regulation on the market in natural gas, the aim is to make the gas trading process as simple and comprehensible as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly option chosen, the trader's central model, in which all activities related to customer service is provided by the trader, one contract and one information and customer service place, shall be left to the technical questions of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being carried out in electricity trading.
Recalls that household customers have a gradual market opening - including after the 31st of April 2017, household customers who are reluctant to choose another natural gas traders will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader on a regulated price, thus becoming relevant users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas end-users with a regulated price is determined by a public trader," the ministry said.
For its part, economic operators will have to choose the natural gas operator with which the gas trade agreement is to be concluded.
Until the end of the gas trade agreement, natural gas operators will be able to supply natural gas for a fixed period of time as a price set by the natural gas operator.
The Cabinet of Ministers rules set out in detail the rights and obligations of natural gas traders, system operators and users.
The rules shall lay down the procedures for supplying natural gas and terminating its supply, the rights and obligations of the natural gas system for the supply and use of natural gas, the extent of the payment transaction, the exchange arrangements for traders, the switching arrangements and the supply of the natural gas supply to the operator, the arrangements for switching and the supply of natural gas in the event of a natural gas supply disruption.

Minister: Next week, the Revenue Service's Director-General is expected to raise his remuneration next week.
Financial Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers), next week, plans with Prime Minister Miss Kucinskis (Greens / Farmers) and government coalition partners to talk about increasing the remuneration of the National Revenue Service (Revenue Service) Director-General.
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Revenue Service's Director-General needs to be addressed urgently so that this post becomes more attractive to the potential candidates.
Next week, there will be talk about changing the conditions for tendering.
She said she was not counting on a specific candidate to address the vacant post.
At the same time Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Kolegova had been a good Director General of the DDA.
On the other hand, as regards the current chief of the Revenue Service's chief, Daci Pelko, who expressed his readiness to claim for this post, the minister reiterated that the new Director-General of VID should be "looking from the side" and should not come from the Revenue Service's structure.
She also stressed the waiting for Saeima to return as soon as possible to move the legislation needed to reorganise the Revenue Service.
The BNS Agency has already reported that Inga Kolegova, Minister of State Environment, has submitted an application to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID Director-General by the Head of State for the Environment.
She said that it was not an easy choice but, over the last two weeks, her relatives have experienced serious emotional pressure, even though there has not been any condemnation of the law.
In addition, Kolegova said that his candidacy had increased the controversial coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
I also reported that Inside Peterssson, Director-General of the previous Revenue Service, left the post at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; the sugar indices in the US and Europe are rising, as well as the US dollar value.
The world's oil prices continue to rise Friday morning, with investors having a positive impact on the state of the Saudi oil minister, which is stepping up expectations that the largest oil producer in September will take action to stabilise the global oil market.
Three main US index indices reached a record level on Thursday, which was not observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also a reason for the European stock exchange index.
The US dollar's value increased on Thursday with regard to the euro, against the British captain and the Japanese jargon.
The new York stock exchange in the WTI mark the price of crude oil for supplies in September was USD 1.78 per dollar to $43.49 per barrel.
In October, Brent mark prices for supplies of crude oil in London increased $1.99 dollars to 46,04 dollars.
Last year's turnover of the canned manufacturer's' Blue lakes' falls by 33. 8%.
The Preservative Commander's turnover last year was EUR 4.202 million, which is 33. 8% less than the year, while company losses decreased by €904,7 thousands to 904,7 thousands, according to the annual financial report published in the database.
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company worked with losses due to a number of reasons, including a permanent deficit caused by the "Unicredit Bank" from the Baltic market, by stopping the existing credit line and leaving "Blue lawn" with contracts concluded without the possibility of meeting them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials and to receive a rebate.
The departure from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing projects in support of the European Union Structural Funds, which would have allowed production to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Similarly, the company's financial generators have had a negative impact on the rise in raw materials prices a year, and consumers would not wish to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of 2016, customers admitted price changes and were prepared to buy goods for the new - higher prices -" the company's leadership said.
In 2015, the Blue Farmers started discussions with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's moving and immovable property.
Investors have already been the largest creditor of Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have studied and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included improvements in technological processes and optimisation, enabling greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"A number of installations providing higher production speeds were purchased," the company manager said.
"Blue lashes" show that equipment purchased in 2016 will allow companies to carry out orders that have not so far been possible.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the declarations on product sales have already been signed, all the production will be sold according to the intent protocols.
The new product will increase the turnover of around 300 thousand euros a month, "the company's manager said.
In August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish to Iraq.
In 2016, the Blue Belt has sent the first pilot container to Israel, extended the market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement in September this year with a new supermarket chain in the US.
As a result of all these measures, the company intends to increase turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Farmers were working with €6.347 million turnover and €5.113 million.
The Blue Film is founded in 1999 and its capital capital is €1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private individuals - Mikiil Kaidanovam (89, 11%) and Igorte Shirška (10, 89%).
It is welcome that 15 to museum wait for the cinema dams, Leanderi and the press conference.
The very beginning of the career of the Kold deserres of the Academy, and inspire cities, can be considered Riga.
The village of the Zars Lenderes on a cross-mother Russ, who was a Swedish Ambassador to Latvia, was in Riga in 1924 because she opened the unusual low contricant of the Zar Leandear, which was attempted by his crowd to Riga in Riga.
Perhaps the accidental emotion in Riga became a fatal turn to the City of Zar towards the world's wounds.
For Riga, Riga was associated with warm memory and she hoped to go to Riga, but unfortunately these hopes were not going to meet, because the Second World War began.
Through the form form, this meeting will be possible for Riga Holy 2016 and the role of excellent Zanderes in the Cold Maanderes will be of great interest to Keriera.
There are certainly wide restrictions on traffic.
In order to ensure the safety of hostile participants in the Youth Guarantee from 12 August to 15 August of this year, the total number of cargo traffic will be closed by a number of national motorways in Aglona, the Latvian national roads said.
These restrictions will not apply to Aglonas holidays and public transport.
It should be taken into account that the car P62 in Preiki-Madona, from the Krablot to a Storage station (0,80-4,0000km), takes place in the construction and refrigeration of Aglonas, only through public transport and pedestrians.
For other road users traffic will be provided by road in the accompanying file.
Traditionally, these holidays come to a large number of participants, including holidays.
Road drivers should therefore be particularly careful because the various road routes to Aglonu will be intensively pedestrian movements.
We call on drivers to treat the road traffic restrictions introduced, to respect the road traffic regime and to count on possible time for longer.

The insurer pays compensation to passengers on Wednesday at the airport's airport.
If the insurance was paid to a family for a family on Wednesday 10 August, Riga airport flight was cancelled on Wednesday 10 August.
On 11 August, the application for compensation was received by a client from some client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but it was not possible for the UK to calculate the rebate on Wednesday, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchase of the festival of the festival in 204.
On the air ticket, customers have promised to compensate the airline for their money.
If insurance from all insurance insurance charges on average, an average of 15% has paid compensation for cancelling or revoking the journey.
"The cost of buying, withdrawing or exchanging tickets, as well as a navernight reservation," said Dagium Rutka, head of the insurance insurance insurance holder.
As you know, on 10 August, a private aircraft stopped a private aircraft because of technical problems in Riga, so only a number of flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be transferred to other airports.
Because of the mediation, the man is on the verge of writing and forced to leave the home.
Dmitry Saidivicv went to Dmitry Saidjavicv, a neighbour of the Dmitry in his apartment, and since then the Dmitry wrote and unsure that he is safe.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and there is a defective ceiling in my apartment.
Then I informed Riga's government, the house manager and other organisations.
The management board said that we are not an operational service and we have no expertise.
"The lodging owner must go in the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry said.
The guest expert arrives, and admitted that the coverage was unsatisfactory.
However, since the first Dmitry application, a month has passed and until the beginning of this week, it was also unable to answer whether there is a danger of being living in danger.
The management board said: that is legislation, waiting if you are not happy, tell everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote Riga, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager is again on the construction board and then there is a deadlock," Dmitry said.
After all, it is clear that the construction works are halted, even though they can be heard at all times that someone is working there.
In two months' time, the owner of the restaurants who carried out repairs in the course of a period of six months must be prevented from remedying all these defects.
The independent expert has produced its opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal metal currently existing in the current design is affected, so it is not certain that the subsistence owner is being created.
"We have therefore requested further clarification from this expert," Ilze Zham, Executive Board of Rwanda, said.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still becoming apparent that construction continues.
The penalty for an arbitrary construction without construction permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a given case, the penalty can be significantly harder.
As long as an expert opinion is awaited, the management board decided that both survivors should not be exploited, both in the form of construction works and the Dmitry living.
"This is not a case of the practice of the construction boards where, in this way, it is not in their own knowledge or simply inconvenience that citizens might not only have a threat to their own, but also to the subprime owner, which would result in the owner unable to operate his property," he said.
It is now up to the Dmitry to look for another place to live - to live, friends, hotel or to rent another living.
But the losses caused by the Dmitry can try to recover from neighbouring civil law, which can take a very long time.
Because of the arbitrary construction of the two survivors, it is now prohibited until civil engineering will give its conclusion, and it may have been waiting for even three weeks.
The losses incurred will have to be borne by the residential owners in which repairs occur.
This residential owner, because of the fact that the construction board has not been taken into account, is also at risk of imprisonment for up to six months.

G Capital Europe owners are a number of investors who invest money in this fund, the elite said.
George Jubi, Executive Director of G Capital Europe said earlier, plans to invest €12 to €15 million in the Strait of Street, with a total investment of €30 million.
It has already been said that, in the case of the renovation of the cultural historical park in more than 42 hectares, the increase in the number of roads and street areas, the increase in the number of tourmala cities and the increase in tourist numbers, the Jurmala City Council plans to mobilise €14.5 million from European Union funds, co-financed by three to four million euro.
By mid-2017, design works are foreseen, but construction works and repairs will start in autumn next year.
As reported, Park Hotel Koemeri and "wellness" or "wellness" or "wellness" or "wellness" are planned.
However, the reconstruction is a long one.
Meanwhile, the Ominasis has been regularly communicating with the Hotel operator in Kempinski, which continues to provide "the reconstruction of the" Ominasis "hotel, and has already been in the process of finalising the preparations for the opening of the Kgropinski chain in 2011.
In October 2014, the Ominasis Latvian chief of Ominasis said that "Park Hotel Koemeri" has been auctioned, but a month later, the auction was recognised as a failure, as the winner was not charged in time for the purchase.
The price of sales was determined according to the last uninterrupted auctions: €2.86 million.

A former NATO commander blamed Russia's hake magazine.
Hakeri's computers of the US National Committee (DNC) have allegedly carried out several other cyber attacks, with the former chief of NATO's former chief, the Serweus Institute, and the Serbian Institute of Open Society, the "Bloomberg" business news agency.
The information from Hakers has been published on the DCBaks.com website.
Among other things, he also posted a correspondence and news about the work of the Sorosi Institute.
Institute computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same Russian speculators, who have broken up DNC e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal reported that US President Barack Obama is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the harassment of DNC files.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have an official cyber attack on the Serbs of the Democratic Party to be accused of Russia or the hakers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported, the website of WikiLeaks published around 20 000 e-mails from DNC's computer system, from which the Democratic Party leader has attempted to harm the former leader of Hillary Clinton, the Senator of Lillary Slinton, in the fight against the election of a referendum in the presidential elections.
As reported by the US press media, the Federal Investigation Office, which investigates the filling of democratic Serbs, and other US special services, the Russian relationship with cyber attacks is unquestionable.

NASA climate model: Venice ever was a residential planet
On the basis of the latest climate patterns of NASA, the Venice era has been a virtual planet.
The NASA Godarda Institute for space research has developed a model to explore Venice history through tools and algorithms, which are also used by climate scientists.
The Model was designed to determine whether the Venice, whose surface is a wot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, once had the same conditions.
Scientists have already said in advance that the slow pace of the Venice slowdown is explained by a dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that the Venice had a plan, a climate similar to the atmosphere and turned slowly.
The model also looks at the Venice earlier topography.
The planet has been more dry than the earth, but it has been enough water and geographical diversity, so that life can be built and water is avoided.
In early Venice, the Sun was 30 percent more.
In a simulated model of GISS, the Venice Greening model reveals that the daily part of the day is for 2 months, while the press explained the GISS scientists, Antonijs Del Genio.
This process warns the planet's surface and causes a case which, in turn, consists of frequent clouds of clouds acting as umbrella, protecting the planet from the Solar cap.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees below the temperature on earth today.
The Model reflects the Venice history, which is similar to evolution theory developed by scientists in their mortgages.
Though it was inhabited, the Venera has been subjected to too high heat and ultraviolet stars over several billion years.
The oceans were shot and the lights were burned by ultraviolet stars.
As a result of full depletion, only a plan for the carbon dioxide of a fatal greenhouse gas, the Venice, which we know today, was only held.
Scientists published the new Venera climate model, Geophysical Research Letters.
PatrTime Rolit resistant from Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrorado's "Avalanche" trailer and hockey chief chief, Patrika Roy, presented a request to the European Parliament, as reason for the lack of influence in the team decision-making process.
He said that the club would start searching for a new coach without delay.
"In the last three years I have been energetic, enthusiastic and determined to play its role as the chief coach and the chief cabin of the Colombian club's hockey Operator," Roy said in his statement.
Throughout this summer, I have thought how I could improve the performance of the team in order to give it the necessary bright and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the main training and hockefield mission of the Vice-President must be fully aligned with the organisation's vision.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
On 23 May 2013, the Say, which was hired by Roy, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
It was wrong to say that the Patrum was informed by the PatrTime of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season, the Avalanche team was found to be the best training player in the R3-2014 team and received the Avalanche Prize.
He helped to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Divisions, and the first round of the graduation games in the first round of the game, the club said in the first round.
Avalanche was completed by 39-39-4 and remained five points after 'Wild' team and five points after 'Wild' teams without the second special call of the Western Conference organisers.
In his career, he wrote four Stenley in his career, two of the Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
Winners of North Sea oil platforms resume negotiations and postpone stress
The workers' strike on the salaries of the workers in the North Sea oil platform has been postponed, as the negotiations between the two sides of the argument have been resumed by the negotiators.
Periodic against the oil treatment company Wood Group is organised to strike on the North Sea oil platforms operating by Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that "Wood Group and Unite," and "RMT," have agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
A number of full days are foreseen in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week with a view to re-examining the problematic issues.
The trade unions said that their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are targeted at a planned reduction of 30 percent.
In the wake of the negative market pressure, the Wood Group decreased wages in the North Sea for 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced salaries of road workers by 10 per cent.
It is clear that the additional wage cuts would allow companies to overcome the market decline.
Shell has already reduced the salaries of thousands of people to the Shell and announced plans to end oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimise their work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British Energy Companies "BG Group.
The energy companies are under pressure because of rising oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the start of the week, the Scottish MEP, Depors Andersons, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea stress plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need the economy from which everyone benefits, not individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost 1.4 billion dollars, compared to USD 7 billion over the last five years.

The latest Cape Telescoping mission has helped astronomes to collect the most complete catalogue of the slash speed pledging summit for Decars.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars are going on this star in different speed speeds, as well as the way in which the speed of the stars is attributable to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that, compared to our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the gold mass, age and even the history of the solar system," the Kremlin Caltech said, and the Analytical Centre, Luisa Rebula, said.
A plea of a plea is 445 years away from the earth.
Many stars in this stars are only starting to rise to around 125 million years.
It has a maximum speed.
Coming with a maximum speed, a large number of stars are distributed by this growing stars.
The men come into the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
With ageing, the pace of their return is decreasing.
Kee is measuring the speed of each sluggish fall in the sun between recognisable stars such as solar plantations.
The latest catalogue of stars shows that higher stars are slower than smaller stars.
Rebulls are comparing stars with desperate, more fruit deceptors are making piretes slower than small fruits.
Rebulled, the trip to the balouts shows that slowly rotating sites are larger and more protracted, while the sooner rotating sites are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the pledging has been so close, it serves as an excellent laboratory laboratory, where the characteristics of the stars can be compared with the slots.
Rebulling is that the Pledging Formny is helping to develop theoretical models in both directions, both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn as to how, when and why, the speed of the stars is slowing down and the whole process of stopping it.
The Rebulls and his colleagues have presented a detailed analysis of the momentum of the steering speeds in three new publications to be published shortly in Astronomia Journalism.
