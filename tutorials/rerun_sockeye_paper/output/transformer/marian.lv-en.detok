, spokesman for San Francisco Galicia, who was found in front of the supermarket in Westphalia on Wednesday, said he was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco citizen, a spokesman for the San Francisco forensic medical expertise office.
reportedly, the San Francisco police said that his death was a murder and an investigation is currently under way.

"New doctors' strike: call for new protests"
, the new doctors' representatives are demanding that their trade unionists take up a protest in the dispute over the new treaty.
"The British Medical Association (LMA) New Doctors Committee (JAK) is going to ask the Council to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
, the JAK considers that ministers have failed to address doubts about the treaty.
"In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract proposed by LMA.
the Treaty was rejected by 58% of all the members who voted.
the government continues to remain silent on this matter, and therefore the contract offer has been rejected, according to a message published on Thursday evening by Mr Mccort, member of the JAK Council.
, she said: 'In view of this, as a result of the vote in the JCESA, the offer of the contract has been totally rejected and a decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues'.
, in response to the government's silence, the JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the drafting of new contracts to come into force in September.
, young doctors have taken part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
resigning LMA's new doctor Dr Johans Malawana as a result of the vote rejecting the contract terms proposed by LMA as recommended by BMA.
, before meeting the 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
"After the vote, Health Secretary James Hant said the contract would be concluded with English medics.
, Russia and Turkey: an alliance of marginalised people?
, who put an end to the crisis.
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to reunite and declare the end of a war of words and economic sanctions for eight months.
"But Vladimir Putin's greetings to the Turkish leader in St Petersburg gave the impression that the partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
, however, they were conspicuous.
, Vladimir Putin's smile looked wet and did not provoke warm emotions, even in view of his usual restraint.
reproach Erdogan called Putin at least five times as his "dear friend," the meeting said.
, I felt the number.
, he said that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but become even stronger.
reportedly, the following day a newspaper reported that Erdogan was behaving as if nothing had happened.
, I think that his enthusiasm is giving rise to conflicting feelings.
, however, the resentment of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
"The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
, Moscow reacted sharply at that time.
reportedly, Putin accused Ankara of inspiring a cognac at Moscow's back.
, given that it came from a friend's side, the damage was even more painful.
"Restoring real confidence will be very difficult, maybe even impossible.
, however, Russia's public position has changed since November.
, for several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
, suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
the most serious was the accusations that the family of Erdogan itself has profited from the illegal trade in oil with the Islamic State controlled part of Syria.
, of course, he denied that himself.
the key message of the St Petersburg meeting, however, that it is time to forget the past.
, after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
, Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
reaping the benefits of peace in Ankara is obvious.
the first is that Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was attempted to overthrow.
, too, the countless terrorist attacks have shaken his position.
, there are also economic motives.
the Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, particularly the ban on charters, which typically ensures the influx of millions of Russian tourists into Turkish resorts every year.
the number of tourists declined by almost 90%.
, including Russian hardware and charter companies, to pave the way for the resumption of regular flights.
"They expect a holiday for the Mediterranean at the end of the season," he said.
, state television is predicting a drop in fruit and vegetable prices this week, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
, as quoted by the local newspaper Vedemosti, 'Turists for them, tomatoes for us'.
, however, the visit also had other political motives on the Moscow side.
"Ankara is angry to the West about the weak response to the attempted coup.
the long-standing EU accession negotiations and the intervention of Putin, who are happy to take advantage of Turkey's alienation from the West, can also be seen to be frustrated.
, the Russian leader undoubtedly scored additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for its elected government following the attempted coup.
-take note that Moscow understands this well, because itself is the deep-rooted fear of regime change in the country.
, the summit that took place in this luxury seaport gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as some analyst called an 'marginalised alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
, however, despite the public displays of unity, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
revolves around Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but, in fact, Russia and Turkey are in favour of the other parties.
, after more than three hours of initial negotiations without wishing to disclose information, the two Presidents stated in a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
the President of Turkey purposefully avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wished to highlight them.
, there is no clear consensus on how the two countries can find common ground on Syria.
, however, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member, Turkey, crashed a Russian combat plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be open to customers outside of Scotland
, the Bank's executive director said, "The role of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) will be to support it in the future."
, Outside Scotland, the SCB will no longer be available.
reportedly Ross Mcevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
relinquished these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
, in the meantime, experts in the brand strategy have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
the Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from the Six Nations Rugby to Vimbldon tennis champion Endy Mureu.
, however, it has now been decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
"The Royal Banka of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be invented.
, in England and Wales, all references by the SKB, outside the headquarters and official stock exchange list, will be transferred to NatWest.
remark The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
, smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also gain attention.
, the macro was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees on the Invernesshire.
reportedly, he told the BBC Scottish channel: "The SKB will become the brand of our investors and with whom our staff are working, because we are now more than a brand bank."
, in time, the bank itself became a global brand and the SKB became a global brand.
, now, I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
, each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our workers will deal with customers under these brands.
"The SCB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the 'Six Nations' and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"The time has come to become a brand bank because we have been asking ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?" he tells us.
, three years ago, it would have been very cynical for us to declare ourselves to be an excellent bank for our clients and to develop these brands.
, however, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of customers rather than on our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
revitalising these brands is something that we can revive again, so I think that now is the time.

, Russia's President Putin dismisses the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov
, Russia's President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
the Ivanov has been in the circle of Putin's closest people for many years.
, the 60-year-old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
the Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "has decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," without giving any reason.
the appointment of Antons Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, in his place.
the 44-year-old, Vaino, has had a diplomat.
reportedly born in 1972 in Tallinn in the capital of Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow National Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
reportedly, the Kremlin's homepage (in Russian) later led the presidential protocol and the administration of government staff.
"Thank you for your confidence," he said to Putin after his appointment.
the main work of the administration, in my opinion, is to support your work as president of the country by drafting laws and by monitoring the implementation of your decisions.
, Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov wanted to leave the post and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
the smiles persuade them?
, Moscow has been confused by this step.
, Sergei Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet security service KGB in the past.
, he was one of the most influential men in Russia in his role.
, both men said that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative at a sitting broadcast on the national television.
, however, despite the smiles that have been wrestled by the cameras, there is rarely any evidence of this, particularly before the parliamentary elections.
, is it the result of the power struggle?
"Nobody knows that.
, however, the official statement that the man who was supposed to be a potential president suddenly wanted himself to be the leader of Russian environmental policy is viewed with great scepticism.
, Ivanov says to Putin in a note published on the Kremlin's website: "It is a fact that, at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust me with this difficult position, one could even say a problematic post, four years.
, I have turned out to have been in office for four years and eight months.
"Ivanov took office in December 2011.
, he was Prime Minister and Defence Minister in the past.
"He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
"At the end of the 1990s, Putin was head of the Federal Security Service, the successor of the KGB, Ivanov held his post as deputy.
, when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he most trusted.

remarked: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the quantum bridge."
revolving in this project, we are seeing an unrivalled engineering solution, where only the construction of this part is used in the form of over 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
, despite the huge size and size of the bridge, bridging the bridge and the viaducts is an extremely delicate process requiring a huge amount of precision.
, in general, more than 79% of the bridge has already been constructed and the final stage, which will connect the bridge to Rositu, will be inserted today, meaning that all parts of the bridge are ready for layout.

remembrance of women in Rio de Janeiro (dpa) - The American athlete Simona Bailsa on Thursday made a celebration on the individual finals of a beam sports exercise for women at the summer 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
"It was the fourth American player in a row to win the multi-battlefield title and the fifth best exercise," he said.
, when the final result was announced, she came out in tears, because the long road to this day was over.
"This achievement puts him next to the unparalleled athletes like Michael Felps, who raised their sport at another level.
rebels have dominated their sport for the last three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling such brilliant, precise and ambitious combinations of exercise that the 1984 Olympic championship, Murie Lar Retone, called her "the best exercise she ever saw."
, in Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a great extent with the expectations she had on her, not with the other athletes.
, she would be disappointed if she came back to her home in Judge, Texas, without gold medals.
reportedly, Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane of the US athletes are witnessing the gold and silver medals of the individual multi-battle women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
the first part of the golden medals was won on Tuesday, making a special sample of the coordinator Marta Karolji defeating the balcony.
, although Bailsa claims that he had not expected anything like this on his long road to the top of the glory, it is still not true.
, part of her performance in the free movements, which include her particular acrobic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would be perfectly fitting on the street alongside the arson of the Rio Olympics.
"It's no coincidence."
, a girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered by a young man's mother of Eimie Barman on a trip to a sports room where she was taking place, has now become a force to be taken into account.
, she has not lost in the multi-battlefield since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bailsa wants it.
, although Mustafina had some leadership during two rotations, it was only an illusion.
revolving beam and free movements - part of the competition where Bailsa will defend his championship - is still ahead of us.
, she led the way with a result of 15.433 on the timber and strengthened the leadership with a result on 15.933 free movements.
"Raismane shouted her mildly while they waited for results that were merely a formality and she came out in the tears when she fulfilled the dream she once recorded in her record book.
the result of Raismane was a little reprisals for four years, when she divided third place with Mustafins, but lost her fight for the medal of bronze.
the 22 year old team's captain, which the Americans call a 'grandmother', came under a convincing leadership this time.
"After her return, she was able to dedicate her to the air smoke crowd," she said.
, meanwhile, her 19-year-old headline Twitter, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning now.

-why do we need Simona, Gabia and Lauria?
, I call it an annual Olympic Vieglatlatlatlatent Comandu, for a number of reasons.
the first is that I have been for all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
the second is that there are three light lats in the team, Simona Bailsa, Gabia Yuglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, which inspire girls from many new backgrounds.
-People can be proud that the team is also made up of Alija Raismane, a Jewish and Medisona Kociana, a Catholic.
, finally, this team is truly representative of America.
, it has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
"The best exercise for the past four years has been that of an Americans of African origin.
the previous year, Simona and Gabia were ranked 1st and 2nd.
, these are impressive results.
the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Duglasa, were astonishing to be the Olympic champion and America could be rampant.
, the world has now seen incredible exercise by the triple world champions Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, carrying out unprecedented but mastery exercises.
, Simona became the fourth American man in a row on Thursday, after having won a gold medal in the individual arts of women.
-Her frightenant Alija Raismane won the silver medal.
, we have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different in terms of exercise.
, Gabia and Laurija entered the Olympic selection in the same way as Alija and Medison.
, because the next Olympic Championship team will have only four athletes, and this is the final year of the triangle of Marta Karolas.
the reality is that exercise is expensive sport: Vingrosters mainly train in private light clubs and are supported by parents who pay for trainings, rooms, travel, formasters, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
the majority of these light-touch clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their training, and this is a costly and long investment for easy families.
Eimie Bhutman, coach Simon Bail, and Megija Hainy - Lauria Hernandess, who has trained her athletes since the two girls started to operate in an athletic athlete.
We must ensure that young girls are encouraged by cheaper exercise training opportunities by Simona, Gabia and Laurija.
I founded my own athletic organisation 20 years ago.
My organizations are located in Harley and we offer exercise training for more than 15,000 young people (mainly black and Spanish), free of charge or at low cost, and we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide local young people with the opportunity to familiarise themselves with this great sport.
Light Latvians are developing the coordination of forces, lotteries and bodies, as well as teaching hard work, discipline and a quest for purpose.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
The team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in an easy latent, and that is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
I would like to thank Simona, Alija, Gabia and Medison for their excellent demonstration of the 'Meel Force', gaining the golden medal of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jos Hanta's proposal was rejected, new doctors plan to step up strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on a change to the agreement with the British Medical Association, which was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who voted.
In July, Hant announced plans for a contract, pointing out that the NHS is in a precarious situation and that further delays would only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract providing for changes to the working conditions for night changes and at weekends in order to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, a new doctor of doctors, Dr Elenna Mcourta, stated that the new doctors were still seriously concerned about the proposed contract, in particular that it would deepen the labour crisis and did not create a level playing field for all doctors.
Eight weeks before the signature of the new treaty by the first group of new doctors, we need to make progress, because time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been met with the government's reluctance to engage and sometimes with total silence.
This was despite the fact that, as far back as last month, James Hant said that his door was always open.
James Hant must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13 000 rubble operations and 100 000 visits were postponed, while nurses and advisers tried to replace doctors who had gone to the piquette.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching agreement on a change to the agreement with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for work at the weekend for 54 000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
The CEO of NHS, Daniels Mortimers, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the burdened workers and worry, cause stress and obstruction for patients, carers and their families.
We have been talking to the new doctor committee over the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions of guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as staff placement, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, dropping out of studies and gender pay inequalities in medicine, shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products can reduce the risk of a heart attack by 2 pounds a day.
Thousands of patients who had heart could be treated with medicines for 2 pounds a day because official representatives recommend that they be used for more people and for longer periods.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of heart readers to people with heart limits.
These medicines are already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart, reducing the risk of a repetitive heart.
NHS's recommendation of NICE to use this preparation four years after the heart of the cardiac to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems for people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE currently under the NHS recommends using this preparation four years after the heart of the cardiovascular in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Each year around 140 000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience repetition of their heart or insult.
The wardstone and insult are caused by the accumulation of fat in heart walls in dams.
If the defect bursts, it can cause thrombin, blocking the blood flow on the heart and causing the heart.
On the other hand, if the thrombin breaks off from a cardiovascular wall, it can get further into a bloodshed and block blood access to the brain, causing infarts.
People who have been at heart are at greater risk of being re-hearted.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca, traded under Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombin formation.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years every 60 mg twice a day with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsona, Director of NICE Health Technology, explains: "Despite having access to medicines to prevent a repeat heart, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart will experience another heart or insult, often with grave consequences."
Fear from a repeat heart can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of repetition of heart and heart attacks for people who have once experienced it.
By recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people, who are the beneficiaries.
Given the limited information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of blood-ascertaining the medicinal product for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness contributes to electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurs Rahmans, former Mayor of Faterhamleta, was dismissed as a result of corruption.
The government's report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Picle criticises the police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the electoral process because they are "afraid of encroaching on ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of communities, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that voter intimidation on religious grounds is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at election stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present identity documents when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment voters should only indicate their name and address.
He even recommends that the voters who have voted should mark their purchases with special ink, in order to avoid double voting.
MPs also need more protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud but also to protect local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it.'
The report was commissioned by Dauningstrite following a scandal concerning the Poperhamlet urban elections.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to cancel the mayor of the city, Lutfuru Rahman, as mayor of the city, because of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahmans "cynically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with the statement that it is the religious duty of religious Muslims to vote for him."
Around 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eric also said that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud in voting by post, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for candidates they want, was particularly worrying.
Sir Eric suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the identification of identity documents.
His report says: 'Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for community senior candidates, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan'.
"There is a fear that the regional institutions do not focus on these problems for political correctness because they might encroach on ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes banning political activists from acting by mail votes cast to prevent the vote from taking place.
The report examined by Theresa May also calls for a more thorough screening of registration to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Considering the possibility of requiring voters to produce an identity document before the vote.
Labelling the votes cast with special ink to avoid double voting.
Systematic checks on persons' nationality to make sure that they have the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic voting by post.
Prohibiting political campaigners and activists from voting by post and by ballot boxes for postal voting.
Providing the police with the power to post the guard at the polling stations.
Modification of the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
No photograph at the polling stations.
A requirement to use English only at polling stations (except in Wales).
Increase training to ensure polling staff make sure voters go to the polling room for one ballot.
Sir Eric is fiercely criticising the Metropoles police, arguing that no charges have been made in the Garerhamleta case.
He says: "The Electoral Court only disqualified Luftura Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was found guilty of evidence of criminal law on the basis of compelling evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient testing of voters at the voter registration stations of the city council's voters.
"Last year's court decision is a wake-up call.
Our land is known to be the homeland of parliament, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of institutions that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.
Visibility with cyclists - Capitan counterpart and other Rio famine counterparts
The 2016 Rio Olympics fans are enthusiastic about the French bicycle Pauline Ferrandu Prevotu, who has been found to be extremely similar to the Street Street Cambridge.
However, a 24-year-old bicycle is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, which, as the media write, is proud of its famous accomplice.
That is why, on the occasion of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that we are seeing now on our screens, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic participants that are very similar to the Hollywood stars.
Master and Land: Breidy Elon, U.S. team member, on the left, has been compared since childhood with Leonardo Di Caprio
Apart from the Kaita counterpart in the bicycle, many people say on the Internet that the cloud might be a superstar Leonardo Di Caprio twin brother.
Breidy Ellon, a member of the US troop, caused a storm on Twitter when photographs were published, where he is very close to Wall Counterfeit.
The athlete also noted a storm in social media and said he was compared with Leonardo Di DiCaprio since his childhood.
"I do n't see a great deal of similarity, apart from a beard," Breidry tells the Huffington Post.
"He's a splendid cheer, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, even more popularity will undoubtedly come from one of the most popular associates of the London Olympics in 2012: the striking similarity between the British long-distance coach Grega Ruterford and the popular actor Nile Patric Haryce.
Russia's light latent Alija Mustafina has been compared with US singer Glory Estefanou, who is of Cuban origin, thanks to his great strong eyes.
As far as bathing is concerned, South African farmer Kamerons van der Burgs has been comparing for several years with the Creative Vision star Metje Morison.
Change: This user has noticed that the Nurse is an "Inception" activist version of the film. "
The ancient activist is also a tennis star, Rafael Kinal and actor Jos Hartnet, who have similar eyes and lips.
Julia Efimova, a Russian silver medallist and actress Annalina Mccorda can be proud not only of sunny skins and blonds, while fans believe that the athletic American athlete Nien Adrian is like Joseph Gordon Levitam.
Scarbb women: The Football Stars (left) Hounei Soth and the Serbian Decsters Actress Jenifer Karpenteur (right) have a similar face form and eyes.
No one: one user on Twitter was pleasantly surprised to learn that others see similarities as well
Theory: this user thinks there is probably a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user was very pleased to announce that "other internet users agree that Houpa and Jenifer Karpentere look virtually identical."
Indeed, for the US football star and the Serbian Decster, the actress is very similar to the face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerry Jeningos and her smile, which is almost identical to Lauras Linnie's smile, as well as a lightweight golden medal winner Gabija Duglasa pride a beautiful, widespread smile similar to Bring It On.
The CBC Olympic Adviser apologises for his comment that the Chinese grey was' dead as a pig '.
Bairona Makdonalda's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas in fourth place in the 4x200 m leftist referee for women, summoned a storm of indignation at CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimming had "escaped from the contest, washed alone" and "finished like a pig."
Advocate Bairons Makdonalds thought his microphone had been ruled out when the 4x200 m free referees for women were finalized at the end of the day.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC's commentator team to give comments life, said: "The little fourteenth birthday from China is unable to keep up."
"She went too far and went out of the race and went out as a pig."
Thank you very much.
The outcome of the second phase of the 14-year-old Chinese flotilla Ai Yanhana was 1: 57.79, which is 1.61 seconds more slowly than the result of the Canadic Teilores Rucka, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
The viewers across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expression.
Emet Makfarlain wrote on Twitter: 'Did a direct CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old bather from China' ended like pig '???'.
The Idiose did not understand that they were still in the immediate building.
Ai Yanha of China's 4x200m free-style finalist was named 'the little 14-year-old from China who does not keep there'.
Criticism of Bairona Makdonaldu quickly came into force, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users were unable to believe when they heard Bairona Makdonalda's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sir Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You are all sounding like racists because of CBC and Canada and because of Tevis.
Shortly afterwards, Scotland, who led the CBC live, apologised for the comments made by Macdonalda, saying: 'We apologise for the comment about the ash result being made in the immediate building'.
It was a failed choice of words and we very much regret that this was the case.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had reacted to this comment on Twitter.
Municipality's Scottish colleague, Rasela, had to apologise for his place.
The CBC then invaded an apology to more than 90 Twitter users complaining about the Macdonalda comment.
The canal also quickly issued an apology and a statement.
We very much regret the fact that such comments were made and they came to the immediate estuary.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologised to all viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, the Bairona comments were made on the grey's performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, these were, in any case, unprofessional and unfortunate statements made and Bairons very regrettable.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonalds personally apologised in the immediate building and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
He said at the CBC live at the Olympic Games: 'I would like to use a moment and apologise for the comment I made yesterday after women's open-style competitions'.
I am referring to the bathers' performance, not to him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect, and I really regret that.
The buyers of Prãk are shocked by a woman who is shamelessly standing in the middle of a subwear shop.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman started to wear her bicycles in the middle of the shop.
As the situation deteriorated, she waited to see whether they stood up and then pulled her and then put her bicycles back on the shelf of the shop.
She continued to search for clothes in Falkeston Bouverie Place Centre shop and passed four more bicycles.
The Bouverie Place at the Falkeston Trade Centre, a place where this woman had the subwear and then put it back on her shelf.
At the time, two children's mother Jenny Devidson was also in the shop, telling us that the unknown woman picked up her clothes after the subwear and left the shop without making any difference.
She says that people could not believe in their eyes.
In the middle of her shop, she took her from the subbicks of the shelf, pulled her flakes and troubles and guzzled them on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to gauge them, she simply pushed them on the ground.
Everyone looked as she pulled the trouble and apparently the woman did not like it because she simply put it back on her shelves.
She gaped three more trouble until she decided that she did not like and left the shop.
He did not seem to be disturbed by someone watching or thinking about the man who would buy the clothes she was waving.
Davidsone from Kenya, 33, says: "The idea of somebody buying clothes that have been stranded by another person and have not subsequently been cleared up."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
She said, "I assume that, after her departure, those clothes were removed from the shop shelves - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine buying a new underwear and knowing that another woman has had it and then has not wiped it out.
The representative of Prãk pointed out that Prãk was aware of an incident that had taken place on Tuesday 9 August.
Certain clothes have been taken off the shelves.
How to protect ourselves from firearms through Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in the close distance from the attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga's supermaster from New York Ronu Mizizizizi.
Whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and take precedence over the attacker.
The exhibitions indicate that if the attacker strikes from the rear, it must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid a shot.
The weapon must then be held between its superior and shoulder and the face of the opponent with its free elcons.
Then there is a blow on the knee in the circus and while the aggressor crashes in the carriage, he has to remove his weapon, pull his face and resign by continuing to take a weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar: a shot trajectory must be avoided, a weapon must be preserved and it must be torn down so that the evil cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and the opponent must pull down the bargain and finally withdraw his arms and resign further to his image.
Listen hard?
You look at the videos to see exactly how Mizizizizi does that.
But remember if you are not the master of Krav Maga, then it is safer to give the robber your money.
A family of Roma demolishes the social house of Saltah Kornwa and is being erected on the street.
The family of chambers has been thrown out of residence for terrorising neighbours, causing damage to social house to 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Son Trebilkok, have been shelved from property in Saltacha Kornwall, as several complaints have been made about them.
When they were forced out of property, the shocked housing service representatives found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the walls and walls, there were lumped waste everywhere and the walls were covered with graffs.
The family is now spared property and is more likely to live in private property.
Donna Makevoja, the operator of the Cornvola Housing Service, says that there are concerns that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She tells us that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like this.
A number of factors need to be assessed in this case, as this property will not be of good repute in the future in Kornvolta.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons, who were periodically owned, and the police say that their terror manifested themselves as violence, an aversion to the street with the beisball cranes, intimidation of the local population, drug use, the sale of drugs and beautiful beacons and apostasy.
The 47 year-old Skeldon, whose name was property, was sentenced in June to antisocial behaviour.
A number of demolished house rooms found extract waste.
In a home where drugs are previously traded, several floor boards have also been taken away.
Neighbours say they regularly walk on the street and were constantly called police.
The Cornvola Housing Service forced them out of property when they had been given 11 weeks to get out of their homes voluntarily.
The desperate neighbours were very happy to have been evicted because their lives were absolutely hell.
One said: 'They were not concerned by other citizens'.
We lived alongside them for 20 years; it has always been crazy.
It is incredible how often we have seen the police here.
We could not sleep this morning.
We wake up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally out, it will be wonderful here.
Addressing Fitzpatric, the head of the Cornvola Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local safety authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called by the police.
Different old and unusable items were found in the home's adulterated garden.
He also said: 'It is a great pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because eviction is always the last step to be taken by the Cornvolve Housing Service'.
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and it was very hard for neighbours to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work done by all my team, the police and the police of Devon and Kornvola in this matter, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and will show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatric said that all three sons had lived here during different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty hair left on the floor in one room after being evicted.
The staff of the service will now have to clean up the purge left in the house.
In 2014, the police carried out a search and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, scales, accessories and 1 700 pounds in cash.
The Skeldone is only found guilty of maintaining class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was earmarked for her son, Le Seldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the extortion, it has become known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimuta.
Many of the walls of the house had been rubbed up by grafite.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their rental contracts.
"This eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said: 'This is a warning to those who believe they can behave like it and have no effect'.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour are unacceptable for the Davon and Kronvola police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Readiness to spend can give the economy a boost.

The mayor of Cannes has banned the carcax swimming on beaches.
The Mayor of Cannes, the southern French resort city, has banned the wearing of carcass swimming costs on the beaches of the city, which almost completely covers the woman's body and very much resembles the hydrolese, local officials said Thursday.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order stating that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing clothing that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"The close-edge clothing, which arrogantly demonstrates religious affiliations at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk to public order disorder (glossary, collision, etc.) which needs to be prevented," the order says.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about an extraordinarily wearing apparel associated with trust in the terrorist movements that are waging war with us," he explained.
He added that the burkcous swimming on the beaches of Cannes had not been seen since 28 July when Linar, the centre-right Republican Party, signed the order and came into force.
In Marseille this week, an acvine cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who wearing a butchery in swimming trees, as the indignation of such an event was expressed by right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France, the headscarves of Muslim women who wear a face are prohibited but religious symbols or related clothing are not banned.
85 people were killed on 14 July in a terror attack in Nice, organised in Cannes, under the responsibility of the Islamic State group.
On 26 July, two attackers who had stolen confidence in Islamic State brutally murdered a priest at a church in the north-west of France.
Jysk last year had a 5% turnover
Jysk, a household goods retailer, found a 5% turnover of EUR 23.66 million in last year, according to Firmas.en.
The company's turnover in 2014 was €22.57 million.

The management report says that last year the company reconstructed the store in Riga, Slok Street, and closed the store in Riga, the Kurdish prospectus.
Again this year, as for other years, the company's main task is to continue to increase both turnover and profits.
In the meantime, the profits made last year are to be left unallocated.
Jysk is an international shop network that offers goods for home maintenance.
Jysk Linvar 'n Furniture was established in 2001.
The capital stock of a company is EUR 3 500 264.

The festival "Cuba" has started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, 11 August, in Lucavsala, a start was given to one of the last festivals this summer - Cuba will be held there until Sunday night.
The groups from the UK, Enter Shikari, who were expected last year but were not seen as missing, NOFX, DJ Maxim from The Prodigy and others, were lutched in the first evening.
In the coming days of the festival, the programme also contains noteworthy words - Guano Apes and Garbage, Markijs Rammono, Marky Ramone's BlitzRussig, Brutto & Lyapis, Belarusian Prison leader Sergei Mihalopoulos, and Vuper at the forefront of the Belarusian event.
This is the second year of Kubana festival in Latvia.
Last year, it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organisers from trying again - they added a taste to the name, it also included a Latvian group (on Friday night 19: 15 on the stage will go up the whole Day Long) and said that the festival 'nearer and obtained a local colorate alongside the symbols of Riga, such as its panorama and cats'.
Will these efforts come to fruition, to be judged too early, because the festival only touched, but, as Delfi Seisure observed on the first night, at least for the time being, enormous efforts by the people were not successful and the number of visitors was the same as last year.
The British Ticycle Team twice corrects the Olympic record and wins the rank.
Britain's third team improved the Olympic record twice on Thursday and won the competition for men.
The first Olympic record British qualified but, in the first round of competitions, it was again corrected by young boys.
The British team with New Zealand met in the final of the verdict, and the British were stripped of the title of Olympic repository owners, leaving them with silver medals.
The final team won 42.440 seconds, reaching 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for the bronze, the French team crossed Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of a women's travel trip, with the British team correcting the record of the world, which is now 4: 13.260.
The President who stayed under the shadows: Gustave Earth 145.
On Friday 12 August, Latvia's second Latvian President Gustav Earth was born.
The globe proclaimed the Latvian state, but unnecessarily remains in the shadows of the first Latvian President, John Chakar, and the last president of the pre-war period, Karlis Ulmer.
None of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Earth's, Gustavv Earth wrote in a book published ten years ago, Arnolds Auzins.
"The Earth is one of the few high-ranking politicians with humour," said Delfi Auzins.
Others like this, always very well.
He taught no such thing; nowadays it could be like Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was close to the people," Auzins said.
Today's politicians do not know history; they referred to Karli Ulman as a good leader, but rarely know how bad he was.
General Balodis has been the only person in government sessions to whom he has not been shouted.
Even if he is kind and smiling in his books, he was hysterical by nature.
"The globe, with its sense of humour and its democracy, gives exactly the opposite impression," says Auzins.
Professor Aivars Stranga, at the Faculty of History and philosophy at the University of Latvia, agrees with the Auzins' assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and balanced statesman.
He also noted that the Earth showed respect for minorities and invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace on a regular basis.
"At the time, it was not a routine act, following Albert Kviesis, who took over the tradition," the historian said.
He was a quiet and balanced man who had to be President for a long time.
He did not aspire to it himself, simply does not beat glory.
He also took a rather critical view of himself, because he did not know the French language, but he thought that the President would certainly have to understand it.
"The French background was learned during the Presidency," Stranga said.
The peak did not allow itself to be repeated in standing as a candidate; he did not like it at all.
In all respects, he is a very respectable figure in Latvia's history, and he was already in a serious position before he came to the presidential palace - a notary was sorely asked for.
He also headed the famous Street Suvorova Street of the Land Spurs 3, where he was a member of a cabinet and craymen's association, practically in a government conversations with the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
There was no great respect for Ulman, but he did not mind publicly either.
"The private conversations have sometimes said that the real Ulmer's actions do not sympathise with him," Stranga said.
After a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How does the Gothenburg remember these days?
It is a pity, but for a large part he only likes a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were central.
"There were no major shocks during his time, which was that he could associate himself with such a stable presidency," he summed up Stranga.
Gustava also held a Latvian visit to Sweden from 1927 to 1930, which implicitly meant full recognition of a neighbouring country and integration into the North European family of democratic nations.
On 28 May 1929, the Earth arrived on a visit to Stockholm.
A reply visit by Swedish King Gustava V to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871 and passed away in January 1939.
Simply ways to help a child cope with the slowness of anger.
I often have to see that the child's anger, the emergence of anger, is seen by parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, Econet indicates psychoe Jekatshall Kesa.
The specialist encourages a little discussion about these natural and human feelings - the anger and anger that everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, angry - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can use our anger and anger: express, suppress, hide, keep it, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can wear a stranger, pick up a cigarette (that is not the best way to dispel the anger!), go into a dozen, put a crow on the table and do other things that are not usually done.
We are not treating our aggression against others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children when they have the anger do not understand what happens to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say 'Go away', you're a fool ',' Bad mamma ',' I don't see you ',' I will not friend you '- and very rarely when you can say' I am angry to you '.
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and indeed in showing their feelings, and often also held hostage by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid a child to display feelings, including anger, not to shame about it and not to do it, but, on the contrary, to help the child.
Is there a need for an end to the relationship?
A long working day in which things have not gone as you would like, or simply bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to be able to close for a moment, a day or even longer.
Can relations be greeted for a moment and breathe a little?
Or is it the case, however, that each partner has a way to go?
There are differences of opinion between men and women in different ages.
Janis (23) is brief and concise: "I think if a relationship needs a pair of pauses, you're not with the right man."
In the meantime, Eduards (30) has found a scheme that could perhaps help someone.
If you feel that a partner starts falling on you for every small detail, then surely it is the right moment to study other hunting fields in order to understand whether you are missing or, in particular, not thinking about him or not at all.
So the answer is yes, holding a passport can save time and see how important you have a second and a half fingers.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, the relationship needs to be accompanied by one of the other on a daily basis, because if you spend a period of 24 hours a day, seven days a week, disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I put every detail that the other is doing and it is starting to fall on the nervous.
People are starting to kid each other, especially when you are not even talking about anything anymore, just about what you have done in the day.
My personal experience suggests this, so I have not lived a relationship for more than a few months either.
If you think for a moment that someone else or others is better, why does this woman with whom you are with deserve to think that it is not good enough and that there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is the little betrayal.
If not, it is not.
"I have, so I am a little sorry for those who do not," said Edmunds (46).
A hair (33) has almost the opposite opinion.
I think everyone needs a time for breathing.
You can't look each moment, all the time, in the morning to the night, at each other in the eyes, and cry for the unloving love.
Attotes.
There are so many things - friends, work, blankets.
Everyone has his or her time.
Of course, a friend or wife too, but if they are both able to keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, they can even live to the edge of the cemetery.
That is the way it is.
Marseille (27) says: 'It is hard to say whether or not it is necessary, may or may not be taken away by a convoy, but one thing is clear: its initiator does not have anything in his relationship at all, something lacks.'
If this question is raised, it must be taken into account that there will be a change in the near future - for the better or for the worse, it depends on itself.
I think, while you are young and crazy, you have had to stop - even all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a different phase, there can be no talk of rest.
You, however, decide to spend all your life together!
"If you cannot behave in each other's society and you need breathing time after time, then what will be when you are pensioners who comment, like a herring cats or arguing about where the garden should be better treated," said Kristaps (19).
All the words of Mr have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozental first waked up the Latin countryman's interest in novelty art.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latin people, which will remain intolerable for ever," Roman Suta wrote at the time.
Also in 2016, the early edition of the Latvian National Art Museum is clear: Rozental is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August but has already been open to visitors since 13 August and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Arts, with a wide retrospection in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hemicycle, honours the sentiment of Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose 50th birthday on the international scene is included in UNESCO's daily timetable for celebration.
A backward-looking exhibition covering more than 150 works is one of the central events of Jaana Rozenthal's annual programme.
The selection of artistic works is largely made from the Latvian National Art Museum stock, which strongly represents the main stages of the creative activity of the classician and the janars, styletic variations and technical diversity.
In addition, the exhibits from Akseli Gallena-Kallelas, Museum of Characteristics and Museum, Liepaja Museum, the Museum of Stevalence and a number of private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The musical atmosphere of the centuries is being revived by the presence of photographs, an exhibition's mobile app reveals photographs of certain works of art received by the painter with his own photographer for creativity.
The Latvian National Art Museum also offers a small, informative exhibition "Looking in Finland, with heart in Latvia," Rozenten-seura, "at the Latvian National Art Museum.
A similar exhibition will open in English, Finnish and Swedish in the autumn at the Virk Gallery in Helsinki.
Leblanks is looking forward to returning to TopGear.
Met Leblanks, head of TopGear television, said he was eager to return to the car shock in the second season, but said he did not know who was waiting for him in the future.
Nothing is happening officially yet.
"If there is, it will be announced by the BBC," Leblanks told reporters in an interview with critics of the television.
Doubts about the future of the gas on the floor arose in July when Leblank's couple Krissa Evanss said he would leave the programme.
"After leaving, Leblank and the gas on the floor," he said, "as created for each other."
Evanss describes the stars of former "Friends" as a "real and good man," thereby dispelling rumours that both friendship crashed during filming.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most this winter, he replied that travelling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reported that the shock was not yet planned to replace Evansu in the new 24th season.
Kalam: Meldonia could already be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes earlier this year.
Mildronate, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, is expected to be removed from the list of banned substances in Latvia earlier this year, said in an LNT programme on Friday morning.
He said that he will travel to Canada in September to discuss the blacklist with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
A scientist said he hoped that the Mildronate would be removed from the blacklist earlier this year.
Two cyclists were taken to hospital in Sigulda after the collision.
In Sigulda, Switzerland's street, two bicyclists came together, causing various injuries, according to the State Police.
The accident involves men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were delivered to a medical authority.
There was a bicycle in the fall in the cock too.
In 1989, a man was born in the street of 1905 and was taken to medical care.
On the other hand, in the town of Dobele, a motorcyclists born in 1989 tried to avoid a dog leased on the road and crashed.
He, too, was in hospital.
Over the last day, 71 road accidents involving 16 people have been recorded in Latvia.
Sometimes it is raining and it will become cool.
Short rain is also expected in Latvia on Friday and it will become a new degree of winds, LETA was informed by the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Center.
For smart bloggers, blogging is possible.
According to estimates, the rain is mainly expected in Kurdish and Veheme in the north.
The maximum temperature will be just + 16, + 19 degrees Celsius.
In Riga, the day will go without precipitation and the sun will prevail.
However, air will not be warmer than + 18 degrees.
In his interpretation, the US model business behind him has had a perversely sophisticated photo rally and the intolerability of the terrible film.
Basically, very provocative, highly sophisticated and banatic volcanic work, which makes it difficult to draw dividing lines between the European art house film and the Hollywood giant's area of product.
The film, with Vigo Mortensen's main role, highlights the issue of whether parents' conceptual choices of life (ecology, vegetation, alternatives and exclusion from consumption in society's genicity and values) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children, idealist, after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the regularity of choices and the true values.
A moving, lifestyle film, whose author Met Ross won this year's Cannes festival award for his director.
Of course, the shark is only doing this as an attack on lofty girls - it was a grey player in the Zoses - in this case, a courageous playman who is reproduced by Bleika Laivley.
The job has been demanding her heroity.
This lifestyle solonic is comparable to Jesse Franco's exemplary activist, 127 hours, and the Ring Reinolda game in the film, About Live.
Perhaps there is also the father's main role, Mila Kunisa, whose change from the exemplary lecturer about the creative survivor and the beautiful family values seems merely to be the result of the fantasy of desperate Hollywood scenarios.
The Islamic State has captured 2 000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State fighters seized about 2 000 civilians using human shields in Manbiya, Syria Aleppo province, the US-backed Kurdish alliance and observers said Friday.
"We did n't shoot them because they brought civilians with them when they fled to Jerusalem," a spokesman from Kurds Menbiya's military council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish Democratic Forces (QSD), backed by the US-backed Kurdish alliance in northern Syria, said Friday that Menbias had been released from jihadists.
The Islamic State PM was in 2014.
QSD has already last week evicted most Islamic State fighters from Menbij, but part of it was held and expressed strong opposition.
On Friday, however, they left the city and brought with them prisoners.
The Islamist movement to Jerusalem, situated at the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (Observatory for Human Rights), based in London, also reported the kidnapping of about 2 000 people by Islamic State.
The Observatory reported that the Islamist kidnapped the city's cars, forced people to climb in them and then took them to Jerusalem.
Islamic State militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, more than 400 civilians, including women and children, were kidnapped by Islamists invading areas in the province of Deir in eastern Syria.
The Islamists later released around 270 prisoners.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled Manbij, is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurd Menbiya military council reported that the QSD succeeded in rescuing 2 500 people held hostage by Islamists in Menbiya.
According to the Observatory, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the battle for Menbiica.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists have been killed.
Colegova refuses to stand as head of the Revenue Service.
Inga Kolegova, head of the National Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy as director-general of the State Revenue Service, LETA was informed by the Finance Ministry.
Kolegova points out that discussing her candidacy has heightened controversy among the ruling coalition parties.
The real reasons for the discussion seem to be linked to the politicians' visible, but often invisible, interests, and they have nothing to do with assessing my professional abilities.
"This is also unacceptable to me," he said.
If her candidacy were to be approved by the government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and that this would prevent the Revenue Service from fully working and realising the necessary changes, with the support of the entire government.
Without it, it would not be possible to perform fully, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly said publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but my entire candidacy process is now over-politicised," the official said.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, this is the experience that I see as a benefit," Kolegova wrote in a petition to Reizniece-Ozoka.
Unity said Wednesday that the meeting with Kolegova revealed a "significant discrepancy" between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers about the cost of dividends, as the decisions of the meetings of the participants at the public Pallogist envisages no profits.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Peleka is the head of the Revenue Service.
The police involved in rescuing two small children left unsupervised, according to the administration of the Latgale region of the State Police.
The news of unsupervised clones with babies was received on Friday at 7 p.m.
They were in Liège near the former shop building.
Both young girls are immediately handed over to the medical community to provide assistance.
A Finnish with documents and a mobile phone was also left in the wheels.
In less than half an hour, law-enforcement officers clarified the whereabouts of children's parents and went there.
When they arrived at the homes of a civilian man, the police found that the woman was sleeping because she was under the influence of alcohol.
According to preliminary information last night, a woman born in 1992 suffered under a spiritual friend who used alcohol.
The woman has already decided to leave the children at the shop under unexplained conditions when she went home after a joint summons.
The police immediately informed the bar court, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Riga Free Cross has implemented all recommendations made by the KK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Port Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations made by the State Control (GCC) on the development of the project on the Russians island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal was informed by Diena.lv.
The approval of the project is planned at an upcoming meeting of the Riga Free Port Management Board.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented at the discretion of the UC, when preparing the documentation necessary for its implementation, the Riga Free Port Authority also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit of the international auditor Deloitte Riga Free Port administration and the recommendations made to improve the project's management during the subsequent project management phase.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent today to the GCC.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Port Authority does not agree with the GCC's opinion on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all construction works planned under the project have been fully completed within the agreed deadlines and at the level planned.
"In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the project, including the EC, the UC and also the moderators, that the main aim of the freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all recommendations made by the GCC on the management and monitoring issues of the project," said Sanita Caire, head of the Russian island project.
The long-term plan of action for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was complemented by major planned actions by stakeholders and by the necessary time frames for decisions, definitions of meetings and periodic reviews and deadlines for meetings and inspections, the instruments for monitoring the construction process planned, as well as the definition of major milestones.
The approved action plan to achieve the project's objective by 31 December 2018, as recommended by the ECC, is complemented by follow-up actions, thus reinforcing the control of the activities of other parties involved in the project by the Riga Free Port.
A project management plan has been redesigned to improve project management and reduce potential risks, defining project management areas and indicating the documents developed to ensure a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
The project's capacity building has been developed by a project management structure reflecting the planned structure, qualifications and functions of the project steering team.
In order to improve communication between the Riga Free Port Administration and the stakeholders in the project, a draft stakeholder communication plan has been developed which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines stakeholders for the successful completion of the project, principles, forms and periodicity of the information exchange.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of funds, further further justifications will need to be given for the need to conclude a service contract or to start procurement, and for the rule of law.
As part of the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure in line with global standards: four new deep-sea satellites, rail accessories, as well as civil engineering communications.
The structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation by the end of last year, with the financial savings estimated at EUR 10.6 million.
The threats in Slovakia have led to increased security at airports.
Slovakia intensified security measures at several airports on Friday after receiving unspecific threats, the Interior Ministry said.
"In view of the threats, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poppy and Košice," a spokesman from the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
On September 16, the Slovak capital will hold an informal European Union (EU) summit with all bloc countries except Britain.
The outcome of the Brexit referendum and the future of the EU without Britain will be discussed at the meeting.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the Communist yoke of the former East German border may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been resolved.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people were murdered at the border with the Western Allied Areas and the later Communist authorities of West Germany who tried to leave the territory under their control.
The border deaths museum has been studying for years and corrects the number of victims every time.
This year 11 more deaths are added to the list, including the inclusion among the victims of a six-year-old boy who drowned in an attempt by the family to enter western Germany via the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The new victims of the Berlin Wall include Soviet army deserts.
"The final damage caused by the double evil of Communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said Alexander Hill, Director of Museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the communist state are maintained and not disappeared," the statement said.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"Sfigure 1841 is unconvincing," Johen Süddeutsche Zeitung, an expert in East German history at the Berlin Free University, told the Süddeutsche newspaper in an interview.
He, along with other researchers from the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only been able to approve 260.
In the past, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by communists outside the Berlin Wall.
In view of the deaths of people trying to flee the Baltic Sea or to enter the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, it is thought that the number of victims could reach about one thousand.
However, it is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of different victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by border guards from East Germany, whether directly linked to their services.
The Museum also counts deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If the elderly between 70 and 80 years of age died of a heart attack after breaking out with border controls," Hilldebrante said.
However, it is convinced that a distinction needs to be made between the old people, who may have died as a result of the treatment they have experienced, and those who have been killed as a result of prolonged waiting time on a hot bus at the border.
Regardless of this, it is not easy to record the victims, as the Communist East German authorities did not store such statistics, and researchers have to turn their documents into a variety of scattered archives, the Sate said.
However, this group has recently carried out new documents and it could therefore present a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The President of the LPF, Pone, to Rio, has the accreditation of a trainer, which is a surprise.
The LPF's president, Kaspars Pone, has been in Rio de Janeiro for the last few days with the accreditation of the coach, but he feels surprised by it himself.
In a statement on Wednesday, the iconic star Ribakow's coach, German Jakubovska, said he had decided to go to Rio for the last minute while the trainer had to stay at home.
Assistants on the list were initially confirmed by Solomon Ribakov and Uvis Kalnins, coach Jakubovskis and Deivs Collins, as well as federation President Pone.
The Latvian Bathing Federation added five participants to the Olympic Games, and even before the departure Aldon Vrublevskis said that Germans would be and are looking for tickets.
"For obvious objective reasons, however, he was not present," Pone said, expressing the view that this did not affect Ribakova's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvan's coach assumed to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the Executive Committee of the LOK, strongly criticised the activities of the LOK, which led to the culpability of the Olympic overseeing organisation.
As far as I am concerned, it is unethical for five individuals to be approved by the Executive Committee of the LOK and one not to be taken from them.
"I do not know why the Bathing Federation did not have any place," Pone said, adding that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated by the public, recalling that the Presidents of the federations did not receive any salary.
Pone also criticised Yakubovsky himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakov was not approved among members, he complained to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send a single athlete.
Pone could not tell why he was accredited to the Olympic Games, which was probably due to Jakubovsky.
"I was announced as President of the Federation (" team leader "), but for unknown reasons I received the accreditation of the coach and now I'm outside."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditation available changed.
Until the last minute, I think Germans will be, because I did not have any other information.
According to LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakova, she had an eye to the eye of Poni and after his swimming with tears in the eye, but the president himself said that it was a daily conversation with athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF is monitoring five sports that are part of the Olympic programme, and four of them also receive training for children in Latvia.
The president of the Federation said that it was also very important to have drowning issues in Latvia and also to have programmes such as this, when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that Latvia could host the World Cup in 2018.
The attack in Rio is not my leave, I am working here, I spent my time and I am trying to carry out the four-year programmes.
There will be 600 000 babies trapped in Daugava.
During the recovery programme, more than 600 000 juveniles of salmon and straw are to be introduced this week in Daugava in front of the Mangave Islands, and more than 600 000 single-year-old salmon and straw juveniles are to be allowed to enter the fish nurseries of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles this year.
Latenergo LETA was informed that the entry of fish will continue in the coming months, with a total of 6 300 000 juvenile and larval species being allowed into Daugava basin water every year.
In spring and early summer of 2016, the fingers and husbands will be released, in June for salmon, in July for the monastery, in August and September.
Maris Kuickis, director of Latvian energy production, said that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of Latvia's sustainable development.
"Any action to protect and reproduce fishery resources shall focus on environmentally friendly activities in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both through the rearing and introduction of juvenile fish into the Daugava basin and through other activities," said Kuickis.
This year, more than 600 000 juvenile salmon and straw will be introduced into the Daugava floors.
For the second year, juvenile fish have been marked with the cutting of the fat pumps before the intake.
Today's cargo contains 25 000 babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, juvenile fish and larval fish are caught in Daugava and its basin water bodies.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies shall be carried out by Bior on the basis of the law and on the basis of an expert assessment of the damage caused to fishery resources by the economic activities of Latvia and of the compensation measures to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
For its part, the National Environment Service decides on the basis of this expertise on the amount and nature of the compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latenergo in the recovery programme is €1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvia has been deploying 400 nests of artificial spawning on Kaibala and Diville for the fifth year with the association "We fish."
Cooperation with the association in promoting the natural spawner of the fish is a complementary initiative supported by Latvia within the framework of the programme for the recovery of fish stocks.
The deployment of artificial spawning nests in water facilities is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fishery resources in Daugava.
The Sun concert room is a rural legs, forest, circus.
The compound is offered by the alternative camermusic festival Suns, who has been calling for a third summer on the Acsiae county, as he is in a restaurant, walking in the gallery and blowing through a quiet nature peace.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former pastoral village, next to forests and circuses.
Within three days - from 12 to 14 August - for five spectacles, an inaccurate enjoyment of nature and academic music can be combined.
This is where the music is faced by the theatre and the daytime circus, performances and installations.
Operation and academic music, especially in its latest forms, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the strength of the concert medicine.
The distance from here to Riga is around 150 km, but to a smile in the face and to ease, just a few minutes left.
"Please do n't look for a programme because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not come to one particular measure or an artist, because the real Sun taste can only be caught for three days," he said.
The festival is open at 17: 00 on Friday and the first concert is at 19: 00.
Of course, there will be programmes on the ground with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we propose Saturday because it is the most painful one - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"Artist names are available on the website www.sansusi.lv," said Richard Freedman.
In the crushing artist's leaflet, for example Vijolent Eva Bindere, Celliste KristumBlaane, the Castar Inga Kalna, the Celsius Grand Music GRecommends Kuzma, Tromlost Janis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zarins, the Circle of Strelcence at Heathrow Heathlete in Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat of the Aquice, the Heat of the Heat of the Heat of the Aquare of the Aquicle of the Heat of the Axitch of the Axit of the Aquice of Heat of Heat of Mmat, and even. of the Aquice of Aquare of the Aquice of Aquice of the Axia, and even.
New works have also been presented for the special festival.
Shows the children of Cocainis, compounded by Oil Kozlovska and Jekabb Nman, who will participate in the entomologist (insect researcher), with Richard Silia, musicians and actors.
Oscar Herliins has been hoping for the first tough Quartet, while Anna Kirir will have the performance of three hectares of trees in three small puds in a crowd of three hectares.
Referring to the voice of Laimas Ledynia, Dinar Ruddy and Zigman Grains, they will end up in a romantic relationship, as in the study by Swedish Nature scientist Chris Linneja (1729) of the Enlightenment era.
The Rio Olympics launch today one of the largest hopes of the Latvian delegation, Laura Ikauniece-Admidina, a seven-battle athlete.
Ikauniece-Admidn will launch a 100-metre race in the run-up to Latvia at 4.50 pm.
On the other hand, the bullet will start on Saturday at 2.35 p.m., while the sprint will start at 4.05 to 200 metres.
Seven-game matches will take place on Saturday, with telescanning, melting and 800 metres of racing taking place.
Prior to the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidst, who last year won the bronze world championship, was named as the winner of the Olympic medals.
Back in May, Latvians set a new record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-battle competition in Gecca, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidina also took part in the London Olympics in 2012, when she won her ninth place again with a record record in Latvia.
Over the past year and a half the country's record has been corrected four times.
Latvia's Judo Gorghrenko, who passes over 100 kilograms of weight in the first round, will also play a part in the fight against the Azerbaijani athlete Ublaghi Kukauri.
Janjail will be the first career of the Olympic Games.
Latvian judo fighter Jevgeny Borodavko had already lost up to 100 kilograms of weight on Thursday, LETA was told.
He conceded to the Japanese Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000 Vsevolods Zelmony brought Latvia the Olympic bronze award, while in the next four Olympics, Latvian Judists won only one victory in seven games in London, which was done directly to Borodavko.
Dainis Upellers will start firing the qualifier on Saturday at 1630 CET, while the selection will close on Saturday.
Upeller received the Olympic road label only on the day the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he told LETA that he had been quite confident about driving since April.
The sports featured as one of Latvia's first sportspeople at the Olympic Games, trying to make the most of training opportunities in the field.
The three matches will be made by Kiev Birzule, the 17-year-old Latvian singer of the Olympic Games, who is competing in a windscreen R: X in class, at 19.05.
In three days' time, or nine trips, Birzule is currently in 25th place among 26 athletes.
On Saturday, the final trip for medals will take place.
Today, we are also finally going to get to grips with the academic roofing of the competition, where Ireland's representative, Sanitai Pushpur, is due to participate.
On Wednesday, the competitions were cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions.
The three finalists for the C / D half-finals will compete at 19.10 for the 13th place at the Olympic Games.
On Tuesday, she scored fourth place in the fourth straight trip, from her third position, which would allow her fight for the medals to continue behind her 0.65 seconds.
The 13th place was won four years ago in London when Ireland was also represented.
Today, the Olympic Games will be divided into 24 medals - in shooting, in light, in third cycling, stamping, expression, tramping, Judo, academic airing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weighing.
She says she would elect Garlande as a judge of the Supreme Court if she were to elect her president.
Harry Rutte, leader of the Senate Democratic Party, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will nominate Merica Garlande as the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked the approval of Garlande since his nomination by President Obama in March.
The Senate's majority leader, Michel McCaaquis, said that the next president would choose who will replace the current Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonina Skaliu.
During her conference on Thursday, he said she was confident that Clinton would choose Garlande.
Reida later said that he had not personally spoken to Clinton on the subject and that they were just speculating.
He praised Garlande and said that Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a different choice.
Garlande is the main judge of the Colombian Congress Court.
Republicans blocking Garlande's candidacy are "waves" and act in the interest of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate said.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the job of president.
Treatment declares the nail photo calendar for women and men.
Treatment will work with David Belgrade to establish the 2017 Calendar of Pirreli in the style of the 1970s.
The 2017 NU Movement Calendar plans to demonstrate new supermodels rather than naked festivities.
At the beginning of this year, the President of the magazine Treats Steve Shov announced that his Aerotic Art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is a male magazine.
This magazine is for women.
It seems that he is also talking about a calendar.
In a press release on the calendar, Shov said: "We have to return to a nebulous and classic picture of biscuit, where the female body does not confuse but inspire both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is an excellent piece of art.
Models can be sent to their photo electronically or in person at the box sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
In Rembaté, the purchaser fills when testing a motorcycle.
On August 10, the "Yamaha YZ250" motorcycle, which has not been registered, has been stolen by the State Police in Rembates.
The owner of the motorcycle had wanted to sell the boat through the advert.
The successful buyer arrived at the agreed time, went up on the motorcycle as if they were going to try and leave.
The staff of the National Police Administration of the Riga Coastal Police are asking for reference to anyone who can provide any information useful for the investigation in connection with the crime that has occurred.
Request for call: 65002403 (during work) or 65002400 (all day to day).

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video view
Scientists say Greenland's sharks have the longest lifetime of all vertebrates on our planet.
Sharks' researcher Julius Nile tells us that the durability record belongs to a mother who could be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
The French court rejects the requirement to dismantle shops in the 'Jungle' refugee camp.
The French court rejected a request by the authorities in Calais to dismantle dozens of self-created shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a hearing in Calais earlier this week, the authorities said that the state should dismantle 72 self-created shops where people sell different goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro in self-created restaurants.
The Prefect Bureau in Calais pointed out that these self-created companies should be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as causing fire and health risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because food provided by governments and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to grow.
They also said shops and restaurants were often offered free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who had created 72 self-established shops, but it understood the prefect concerns of Calais.
Judge Francois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people living in "extremely uncertain conditions."
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids camp cafe, which provides over 200 free meals per day, English and French instruction and provides advice on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of a child's cafe.
A letter addressed to Guardian states that the dissolution of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
On Friday, two charities helping refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants said that the number of residents of the Jungle camp has risen to 9000, the highest since the summer influx of migrants.
Britain gets silver in rugby - 7 series when Fiji's national club is grappling with gold.
The spectacular performance of Britain's rugby rally ended on Thursday when they were decidedly shattered by a 43: 7 win at the Rio Fiji Champions League on Thursday.
Fiji showed masterclass in the management of the bomb, the ball was in leg, support and brutal power in the game of grabbing the gold, the first Olympic medal in its history.
The response brought a worthy award of comfort - the silver medal that was Britain's third medal then - and the British selection can be proud of its success at the first Olympic rugby to the seventh tournament in which they conducted New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the first half of the 7: 5 day, the Boks defeated Britain in the first half of the week.
But, in any case, Fiji is now in its best shape to win a team of 15 men.
However, some reassurance might be that Britain won the gold medal, which is the Fiji coach Ben Ryan, a former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was a fascinating adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ray, they lost all the games in rugby - 7 series in Adeade.
This time they only lost one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is astonishing.
Fiji was impressively embarking on a match, unleashing Britain's strength for joy.
Captain Tomas Michel and his comrades were in contact with several rebound buses and the World series Championships led the way with 5: 0 when Osea Kolinisau was the first lane.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai has also increased the prevalence by making the underground on the right wing even more.
The outcome of the 12: 0 and British teams had not even really touched the ball.
The splendid power method did not allow Leoni Nakaravam to have three points, but only slightly influenced Fiji's result.
Jasa Veremalua went down to the right corner in the seventh minute of the game, strengthening Britain's dominance to 17: 0.
Nakarava increased the predominance further after the shadows and left more than a minute until the end... the first half.
On the other hand, Mr Ravouvou avoided a few failed methods of British force and crossed the line with points.
Low yielded a result of 29: 0.
Fiji seemed to be born to play rugby with 7 matches while the British were still studying.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made a profound half-time change, breaking the Fiji line... four minutes that were good after half-time, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dens Norton was able to score points for the British team by landing on the left corner and achieving a result of 36: 7, but the game was lost, while southern salarian fans were singing, waving flags and dance in the tribes.
You cannot help but admire Fiji's living attitude.
Mata Viliame added another sweep to Fiji's victory at the end of the game.
Fiji was able to celebrate the game after the defeat and the British were able to sit in the row.
Fiji hit Japan in the first half of the day with 20: 5, while the British were above South Africa, where both teams were on the ground in a very fierce battle and southern frictions lost only a few points.
During the first half, Kail Brauns put forward the Boks' team, while in the second half Dsen Norton had a shining master crossing the line and brought the ball between the trees to a victory for the British.
On the other hand, Mr Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Rugby, who is the brother of England Rugby 15, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The fight against cancer has been inspired by the victory of Helena Glover and Heteri Stanings in the roofing competitions.
It will be the most emotional part of gold in these races and it is already saying a lot.
From the first to the last storm, the gold of Helena Gloveres and Heteres Staningas played a special role in Estacio da Lagoa's tracks.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they spent the voice of Robin Viljamsa, who inspired them to get their second Olympic medals into rowing women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport to have such success.
They were undoubtedly dominated by the fact that, once 39, they had an unrivalled, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with bed elegant drowning under the surface of water do not fully reflect this triumph.
There is a team behind every golden meal that works hard to keep sportspeople improving their performance and the biggest contributor to their success was a coach who did not know until 30 months ago whether or not to live that day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had the cancer of the uproar, which is one of those that can and has been operated.
If it did not do so, it would spread across the whole body.
And the situation would become out of control.
This slightly alters your vision.
Counterfeiting Cancer opened in December 2013.
This trio was lucky enough to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intermediate season and to reduce the interruption to a minimum, if I may say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It provided an impetus for recovery.
I was in hospital and I went 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, even though the doctor said that some steps would be enough.
It all started.
Aircraft in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Wilders, who spoke more about the whole morning in terms of alarm and alarm than usual.
Stanning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, 'This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me'.
It just confirms how much this means to us and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years with Heln and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine better trainers or better coaches.
Helena Glover and Hetere Staning have not lost any race in five years.
The couple is getting so much speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to approach, the dominance of Staningas and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helena shouted: "Supplement rhythm, preserve the rhythm."
Continued focus is indeed important.
We managed to get a good start but, at the same time, we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of overturning records, but simply of rowing and winning the race, and that is what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month, there will be Stan Bashala feet for Glover and TV adventures.
So far, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.
That was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, 'Granta is fantastic'.
A unique opportunity to look at the fantastic architecture of the Central Library in Los Angeles.

Colegova as head of the Revenue Service will "move to the last."
He said that Prime Minister Maris Kuchinskim (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Minister of Finance, Danai Reiznie-Ozoka (Union of Greens and Farmers) are now "fundamentally important" to approve Kolegova as head of the Revenue Service.
Rajevskis estimated that the approval of the head of the Revenue Service by both Kuchinskim and Reiznie-Ozok in this government was a "first big decision" that could affect their future as politicians.
If the position of the candidate for the post of head of the Revenue Service now begins to be changed, this will have a negative impact on their immunisation in public administration.
The agenda for next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers on the issue of the transfer of the head of the State Revenue Service, Kolegova, to the post of Director General of the Revenue Service, according to the government's agenda.
Colegova nominated Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola for the head of the Revenue Service, following the resignation of Inar Peter Petersone from the head of the service, and when the tender for the Revenue Service's post ended without result.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday 11 August, Dace Peleka, acting as head of the Revenue Service, admitted that if she was offered a candidate for management, she could agree.
The finance minister later admitted that she did not consider any other candidates for the post of head of the Revenue Service.
Raivis Dzintars, head of the Saeima Saeima group of the National Union, also said that the NA was still in favour of Kolegova under the leadership of the Revenue Service.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit is threatened by the failure to form a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) stated that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the euro area.
Estimates suggest that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4. 4% of GDP and in Spain 5. 1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not, however, introduce sanctions against the two countries is the increasing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions for such a negative mood would only multiply.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on common rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmanns, has said that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are advisable, not binding.
Now the EC has proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for correcting their deficits until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if conditions so require.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal could meet its target on time and this year's budget deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of that country must implement austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with a further focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4. 6%, to 3. 1% next year and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, in the next two years, consolidation measures must be 0. 5% of GDP annually.
It is particularly difficult to achieve these objectives that the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on the formation of a government for eight months now, and the possibility of Spain holding early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year is growing.
However, opinion polls show that the political scene in the country would not be profoundly altered by the third elections either.
The Popular Party remains the party of the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, which would win less than 33% of the votes again in the elections.
Only the Socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the anti-austerity party Podemos or "Together we can" and Ciudadanos or Citizens have slightly weakened.
The People's Party wants socialist and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the 2017 draft budget to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
Rafael Hernando, the spokesman for the People's Party, said that if the government fails and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughter for the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of socks in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
A fifth year on the beaches, the activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found is increasing year on year, and the vast majority of bathing water visitors are responsible for this.
The most polluted bathing sites are precisely in Riga.
The city council explains that bathing sites are copied every day, but it is difficult to combat dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on land during torrential rainfall can be washed into water, thus greatly damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beache and some sites in Kurdish, the purity of beaches in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This is a message that has been spread this week by volunteers in the 'My Sea' campaign.
In their fifth legs on the road along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population increased by one hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year, this has been a critical assessment.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach is probably more than 200 units," said Janis Ulme, spokesman for my sea.
In Latvia, radio, he was on the hall of Toulouse, where a voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga was continuing.
This year, even fluorescent lamps that are left in the sand have been collected between the various municipal waste and the picnic resistants.
It is the citizens who are responsible for the pollution and the organiser of the voyage, Ulme said.
"The main source is the beaches themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already at the degradation stage, they can no longer be identified, and smoke, bottles, corks," Ulme tells us.
Among the dirty beaches are the bathing sites in Riga.
For example, nearly 800 units of waste collected every hundred metres on average, which is a critical mass.
The campaign's organisers also explain that when you drink on a toll you also smoke and do not have warning or prohibition marks everywhere.
"The average figures for all three bathing sites in Riga - Daugavano, Yemeni and Ellen - unfortunately come big and far above the desired target, which Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020," he said.
Peelling sites in Riga takes place daily, even twice in summer hot days, according to Ugis Mediauskis, spokesman for the City Council.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We come back to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who refer to alcohol, drink, smoke and do all the things that cannot, even special signs, do not work," he said.
To this end, KICs are calling for polluters to be notified to the police.
You can call the police, you can safely point these abuses and so you can fight everyone.
Perhaps some new warnings can be made but, as I said, it is unlikely that the situation will change radically.
He went on to say that "since everyone together simply has to take action and be intolerant of such offenders," he said.
Meanwhile, for the fourth time this summer, a health inspection has been carried out, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as for other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that, in all 56 bathing sites, water quality has been good all the time and there are no bathing restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analyses at the end of August," said Normunds Kadić, the top inspection expert for environmental health.
Waste left on land during heavy rainfall can be discharged into water.
This, in turn, may affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
Rotation in the Russian elites continues - change of driver in Putin's administration.
He left the post himself?
Vladimir Putin has told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov had left the post himself and will continue to be the President's Special Representative for Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin gave positive words to Ivanov before the television cameras: 'Honourable Sergej Borisvič, we have been working together with you for many years and we are doing it well'.
I am pleased with the way in which you carry out your duties.
I remember well our agreement not to use you as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
That is why I am conscious of your desire to change the scope.
And I hope that, in your new position, you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the administration of the presidential administration is a very important position and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming Duma elections in Russia next month, there have been rumours that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible substitute for Putin as president, so his claim that he himself wanted to hold the post of presidential representative on nature conservation and transport has given rise to doubts.
According to the Archive of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the general Colonel of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started in 1975 with Putin in his track-office.
Later, as Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
The first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his term in office.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the Ivanova 'Information Security Doctrine', which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia, was approved.
In 2001 Sergei Ivanov became the Russian Defence Minister, and in 2005 he became Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkova and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also remain in the Russian National Security Council, where Vaino, the new head of the presidential administration, will also work.
The blame comes from the Soviet Party of Families in the elite.
Vaino, the head of the presidential administration, was himself appointed by Ivanov.
We have long known Antonu Eduardovic with him.
Out of the times when you were in government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we have been communicating practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that he is ready for his work, in all professional and personal terms," Ivanov said.
The blame comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet Party.
His grandfather, Karls, has held senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including his first secretary until 1988.
The internet publication Meduza, referring to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence," said Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators at the end of the 1980s.
However, he was refused and lost his post soon.
Shortly afterwards, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Antonis Vaino has graduated from Moscow's Institute for International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the presidential protocol.
As reported, the last giant Russia has been shaken by the suspension and even arrests of several senior officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives from several regions.
President Vladimir Putin is running the ruling elites ahead of the elections in 2018, according to polyitologists.
One of the key features is the increasing number of representatives of the force's bodies in leading positions.
Judo's joyman, New iciforenko, also loses his first battle at the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of fighting, and the Latvian Judo Zeng has finished his participation in the Olympic Games by finishing his 17th place.
Trenker Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that there was very little hope, and this had already been clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the Judo fighter had a shoulder of injury in the fight.
Significantly, in order to be on the Olympic road, Niziforenka had to appear in a different weight category than that recorded - i.e. up to 100 kilograms per weight.
Azerbaijan's fighter was 25 kilograms heavier.
As reported, Jevgeny Borodavko held two and a half minutes in the range of weight to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki until the opponent had succeeded.
As a result, Latvia has concluded the Rio Judo competition.
The clocks are disappearing in the Rio sand.
On Thursday Judist Jevgeny Borodavko was inaugurated.
Yes, he had a more pronounced opponent in return, but the ambitious ones can sometimes come as a surprise.
He did not.
Archiforenko's task was even more difficult, because experience is smaller and respectful.
The result was similar, if he stayed almost a minute and a half for a tatable, longer than Borodavko.
Recently, unfortunately, it is the Latvian Judians who have the greatest lack of ambition.
Gunars Kirsons, who has been on the edge of the federation's head, and his financial contempt Vladimir Shestakovs, travelled from Latvia to Alexander Jackevicius, is no longer taking place in the Golden Score, the Judo development is going down the downward curve.
Jackevicius, who is advising the Kazakh Jupskie here, and Vsewall Zelonry, is not seeing the heirs.
But if it doesn't grow, there won't be.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
That is why the pledge made by the President of the Latvian Judo Federation, Rio, to win the medals, from another galaxy in Rta Panorama.
Flight from reality.
In the evening, we were impatiently awaiting and concerned about the beaches' bench, Samoilovs / Shonins - Mr Solbergs.
The losers have come to an end as they were in the 'death' group.
Latvia had a small derogation - it could also lose, but with no more than four points in two sets.
There was still a tension in the last long game.
Nobody wanted to die - the feeling over the whistleblowing was full of the game.
For the players, the brother wind caused additional complications.
At the beginning, it seemed that it could be our - more comprehensive - ally.
But it did not happen.
The Latvian duble to play here was quite simple.
Serbs on Samoilova and waiting for him to burst.
Canada was burst, Cuba was burst at the end of the first face and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not a joke.
Saugins were able to angle at the time because there was little work, but when it was, they did it honestly.
The Brazilian Samoilovs could win in two cons with Shonland, as the first one took over with 16: 15, but it was also remaining for 16, with the limit of the points lost.
But it was also possible to lose 0: 2 because the second sixth deficit was -4, but the wind also won.
The third was in the eye of Evanpe's Conservatives.
There was a chain of poorly received serve, the second ball is often too close to the network, and Samoilov remained very few options for a fruitful attack.
If there was an alien Samoilovs on the square, this time he was more successful and it would be unprofessional to draw the damage to him.
The Kremlin was also wrong and, symbolically enough, he shook the last bomb blockade.
There was a team.
There was certainly a lack of success this time - in the third half alone, two attacks by Evandra were almost out of the cort, but the ball hit the line.
Two lakes were next to the line.
A video of the contentious episodes also decided in favour of the opponents.
If the first two games in Evandra were married with servers, then they were very productive to ours.
In total, everything turned out to be lost on the taboo.
Now the causes of failure need to be analysed calmly.
Perhaps it should have been as many as a stadium and not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours have passed.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a seven-finalist series.
Maybe it was not necessary to play in Clasgenfurt, but to come here more quickly and to acclimatise better.
Perhaps it was a mistake to find the top of the sporting form.
So far, the question is more than answers.
The game is over for our beaches.
The circle of medals is over.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup tournaments remain and also Jurmala Masters.
Shonins and Samoilovas have never been friends and will not, because there are too different personalities.
That is not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, there may also be a thought of divorce, because blame will be sought not only in itself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to succeed, but it will be much harder to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
The two brothers are playing the barrels, while Janis has tried and also self-cleaned, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to get down to the top of the world.
One can try to go back to Marti's Guard, Alexander Soloveya, Edgar Tovich, but it will not be better than this option, which not only demonstrated itself once in the World Cup stages.
The sand of the coding did not smile them this time.
And it is all.
Of course, we also have to take into account the fact that beaches are becoming more popular, new couples are circulating, and only the rare growth is less than two metres.
It is not yet a guarantee of success, but there is an important argument in the battle for victory.
The modern age does not stay longer.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to live in the places offered by gamblers and choose their own.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, a part of the tennis tennis does not remain in the Olympic village.
The beach's favourite has also been searched for a hotel at Cohaban.
This time, rather modest nights offered to journalists were demanded of exaggerated prices.
The choice therefore also fell on the tenure of apparatus.
The risk is there, because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk justifies it.
Along with Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir, hiring apparatus on the Kohana and Ipanema border.
The shooter is 200 metres away, a bar arena half an hour in a march.
Skajon is quite safe, because the favelas' paternity, but the vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Rovich is not something some imagine at once, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media, Vladimir Ivanov.
The dream of another medals seems to have been dreamed out on Friday morning.
The 100 metres into the barrack and the highs of Laura Ikauniece-Admidil lagged behind their personal record.
But there are still five disciplines.
Porgijs and Besa were in Liepaja after a 10-year break.
In 1973, Opera Porgijs and Besa went on to visit the Latvian National Operation.
Since then, the internationally recognised dosage has not been re-inflicted.
That is why the organisers of the Cesa Art Festival and the Liepaja Arts Forum have decided, in close cooperation, to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Guershvina's snow.
"We are very pleased that, after a ten-year break in the last time that Liepaja was able to enjoy opera instruction, this great version of the concert of George Porgijs and Besa's Baiba Bože concert is welcome to us in the new, open-ended concert hall."
Porgijs and Besa are the story of love, its inconsistency, passion, as well as the tragedies of living and simple everyday joys that have been expressed in a brilliant musical language.
It reflects the Afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera that makes it so lively, this exclusion of tolerance.
"And yes, this mystery is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way deep," said Viesturs Cairo.
What I like most is - listening to or playing this opera - always there are such sticking points - the famous monasteries, the famous motives, but these shifts from one nature to another, bringing up one person or another, or corrupt or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting building, this building," Opera Porgijs and Besa's musical manager and conductor Andris Poga assesses the performance.
Visitors to the operation agree that this is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear this famous Guershina opera in the world.
Holy, Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
"Professional execution," Opera is valued by the visitor Edgars Lama.
The concert showed that for the first time in the new open concert hall the orchestra bedre played the orchestra and for the first time there was an operational concert behaviour.
The agriculture on the Museum of the Arl'la Museum could be named after Jaana Rozental.
Riga Vice-Chair Andris Americ said that the Museum's own address could be not in the future Valdemar Street 10a, but Jaana Rozenthal Square 1.
Museum Director Matar Lars said that re-registering the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but in general, this idea was welcomed and therefore agreed to the local government's proposal.
The city of Riga has given a kind of basic stone to this idea in 1936, by setting up the Burkarda Dylan Monument for Janim Rozentane, who is standing on a museum.
The then director of the museum, Vilhelm Purvins, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little shaken by the conscience all the time - but the Sahelm Purvitis, where are we going to put his name?
"But if you, Mr Americas, promise to think," he said.
The National Art Museum building was officially seized in May this year after major renovation and modernisation.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Castle will finally begin.
Around €11 million will be renewed for Welve.
It is planned to renovate several castle rooms, including two viewers' medicines, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to raise EUR 6 million of EU funds to the project, but Oleg Burov, director of the Riga City Council's property department, recognises that the project does not yet have full clarity on European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to launch the VEF's cultural piliate repairs by attracting the European Structural Funds, there is, we expect months of decision, real action from officials at the Ministry of Finance, there will be money allocated for it or not," he said.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you would decide yourself that Brussels does not take a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussions coming up again, now we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed in time," he said.
As reported, in March 2015, VEF Cultural Castle collectively held a descend concert before the building was renovated immediately.
One year on, renovation of the building was still not started and continued collectively to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the Riga City Council Special Department's strategy, the refurbishment of VEF Cultural Castle was divided into supposedly independent works of reconstruction, where each will ensure the implementation of different palace functions.
Firstly, increasing the availability of VEF Cultural Centres and renovating the surrounding area.
It is intended to bring the surroundings and engineering communications into order, as well as to restore the façade of the building.
Second, improving the offer of services by VEF's Palace of Culture.
It plans to upgrade the building's interviewer, wall and ceiling restoration, stage and sound recordings, as well as to get the building's internal engineering communication in order.
Third: improving collective working conditions for creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the centenary's 40th anniversary group can be read at an exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover a variety of "grand" descriptors - photographs arranged on the line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's end is announced.
The participants' scenes, musical instruments, awards and concerts will also be shown, as well as other unseen cases for the general public, which reflected the creative activities of the 'Levels' group.
The exhibition will be complemented by objects of Liepaja Museum.
The visual form of the exhibition was presented in cooperation with Elite Patmaliers, the fashion artist and the painter.
The musicians who were associated with the Holy group and their loved ones also responded to the call and shared objects and memories.
The Heavy comes in 1972, when a vocal ansamblic, led by Juris Pavithol, is set up in the Liepaja House of Culture.
Ansamblis was present at the Liepaja engine festival in 1972 and 1974, as well as at the town and republic.
In 1976, a fatal meeting took place when Juris Pavile inaugurated Eric Costal and founded a group in the culture of Metalurgs calling for Ingride God, Andri Krumins and Janis Grody to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has ever noticed.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is capable of living and living remains the same.
"What was missing is that the marathon, the matches and the barley, these boys were very different from the generally accepted gesture of eating," the music viewer Keel said.
Besides the musicians mentioned above, the group has been composed of excellent musicians such as Hugo, Vilnis Krieins, Modris Schtern, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rhecene, Fashar Pusbaran, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brise, Guntars Mucensene, Dainis Virga, Tomas Klein and many others.
Access to an exhibition shall be free of charge.
The exhibition can be seen between 19 August and 30 October.
On August 27, at the Liepaja concert garden "Buy, the winds will be held at the Larenfest 2 anniversary celebrations for 40 years.
For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria is experiencing inflation.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first above zero since October last year when it was positive (0. 2%).
The annual average inflation rate after PCI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0. 8% compared to the previous year.
In July 2016, the Consumer Price Index was 101. 9% compared to the previous year, and the monthly average inflation was 1. 0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0. 2% (in July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0. 2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, prices for the following consumer groups were rising in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1. 7%); transport (1. 8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6. 3%); hotels and restaurants (1. 2%); domestic goods and services (0. 3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2. 2%); housing, household appliances and regular domestic clean-up (0. 5%); health (0. 1%).

Zbigniew Stankevicius: Time is running out and the truth goes to the fore.
The Archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, Mr Zbigniew Stankevicius, says that if we want to win life, the message of Gospel must be put at the heart of it.
The strength of the truth is greater than the whim of evil.
Many are already on the way to Aglona, the most holy entrance to the New York Skills in Maria.
What kind of message will the believers get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been expressed by the Pope Nun.
Consequently, the content of the key message is also up to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that Bishop Janis Buslis is running the cruise.
He, too, will form his own message.
I was last day in a service of a holy vignette.
Last year, I focused on Pope Francian encyclical Laudato and raised the common house, the Earth's topic in Latvia.
This year... I am, of course, watching what is happening in the world and trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the suggestion of the Church that the message of Gospel should be put at the centre of life.
It must be demonstrated that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in the Chechen discussion, you said that 'back to the understanding of the full man'.
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person is turning a blind eye to a church's message?
And is the church today a source of such return?
A man on the side of the road is being robbed in the Indian capital.
In the Indian capital, no one has ever been aware of a dead man on the side of the road - he appears to have stayed at the side of the road an hour and was then robbed, the BBC said.
The man who has been identified as Matistle was in rice in the day and worked as a guard at night.
The car was killed by a passenger car on the road in a 5: 30 morning.
According to the observation cameras, the driver has pulled out of the car to see the victim and then left.
After an hour, when nobody was aware of a bloody man, he was robbed by a spiritual man.
About 90 minutes after being shot, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died from injuries.
Referring to his candidacy as Director General of the State Revenue Service (Revenue Service), Inga Kolegova, head of the State Environment Service, has rescued the government from falling, according to Professor Oir Skudra, associated with the Social Science Faculty of the University of Latvia.
Colegova's interpretation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions within the ruling coalition is attributable to her having prevented the government from falling.
In a conversation with the club, he said he could hardly imagine Unity supporting Kolegova's candidacy at next week's government meeting.
So if the Unity Ministers voted against, but Kolegova was approved anyway, this would lead to the government's resignation.
He also considered that Kolegova had consulted both Finance Minister Dana Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mars Kuchinski prior to his announcement of the withdrawal.
It was also a "Unity" concession, which was strongly opposed to her candidacy.
Looking ahead to finding a suitable candidate through the competition, Skudr said there were two options: either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution will continue to be led by Dace Peleka as Director General.
At the same time, however, he says that if the finance minister so far claimed that no other candidacy had been considered, it was a hint of the Peleka that he could not take part in the contest.
As reported, Kolegova, head of the State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy as the Revenue Service's director-general.
Unity's opposition led the government to postpone approval of Kolegova as Revenue Service's chief on Tuesday for a week.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that he was still ready to head the Revenue Service.
However, she later turned her thoughts down: on Friday, in an application by Finance Minister Danai Reiznie-Ozoka, she said she withdrew her consent to a transfer to the Revenue Service's head and she had no easy choice.
Prime Minister Maris Kuchinska's press secretary Andrei Vaivars explained to LETA that a new competition would be held for the vacant Revenue Service's Director General.
There was a crash involving the police car at the centre of Riga.
At the centre of Riga this afternoon, there was a road accident involving the National Police Car.
The police car has rushed with sound and light lights on the top category, while crushing Barona and Dzirnava Street intersection with another car.
Police explain what happened, but initial information suggests that the second game has not passed the police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
Latvia's population shrinking this year
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0. 34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Office (CSP) informed LETA.
The Latvian capital is ranked 30th in terms of population between the capital cities of the European Union and large cities with a population of over one million inhabitants.
According to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office in Riga has the highest proportion of women, with the capital city of Latvia holding the highest number among Europe's major cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in major cities in Europe: 123 in Vilnius and 121 women per 100 men in Tallinn.
Warning pictograms will be released at LNMM.
In the coming days, warning labels - pictograms - will be displayed around the Latvian National Art Museum (LNMM), the Riga City Council's property department's spokesman Baiba Gailyte told LETA.
The repair of the damage to the museum glass, which was the result of the activities of the scriptwriters, has now been successfully completed.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be available.
Its citizens will be told that the cover tends to be slippery and snow, not to be driven by cars, but also to visit bicycles, brigade and bribery.
Usakovs also wrote on Facebook at the time, saying that there was no damage to security, but "it looks like no aaches," and the sketchers would have to be cleaned.
Children and the elderly have young children's playgrounds in Riga.
During this summer season, Riga City Council has installed two more new playgrounds in the city, Riga and Chinston, which are already available to children.
A large, multifunctional toy vessel with various sticking elements, bridges, games, trubs and snipers has been installed at the beach.
The House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Farming also contains cells and various balancing elements.
The world of Fanthropy is stubbornly parked by small sailors on the Daugava coast with a look at the port of passengers and the cruise ships there.
On the other hand, the game house, batch tracks, bridges, bridges, cracks, rock bombs and other playgrounds, as well as the exercise zone with purse seines for training and coordination, co-texts, etc.

The honey shows the reconstructed road.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, head of VAS Latvian National Routes (LVC), as well as representatives of the construction company Binders and local authorities today opened the reconstructed main road Russian border (Grebńeva) - the Greekne-Daugavpils-Lithuania border (Medums) (A13) from honey to the Lithuanian border (156,163,05 km).
The roads are a national visit card, especially for border roads, so it is particularly gratifying to open a revitalised section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how, thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"The funds available during this programming period will be absorbed as early as 2018, and we need to think how to continue to maintain the most busy roads in a very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," Uldis Augulis said.
The Transport Minister also pointed out that the proposals made by transport experts for sustainable financing of Latvian roads would be presented to the government in the near future.
The construction works from the honey to the Lithuanian border (156,163,05 km) were launched last year and continued this year after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"On the reconstructed road section, the road is fully reconstructed and repairs will start next year from honey to Daugavpilij, so the whole road from Lithuania's border to Daugavpilij will be sorted out," said Janis Lange, board chairman of the LVC.
The country's main roads are the most burdened, and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all the country's main roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring timely maintenance and by changing the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all guests look forward to the proposals made by the group of experts to clean up the road financing system," said Mr Lange.
The project has brought road connections and lighting into the centre of honey.
Significant land-work has been carried out: four stages of large-scale decoupling and large-scale injection and embankment work, matched the longitudinal profile of the road, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a re-built return space for public transport has been built.
In the past, there was a lack of capacity on the road and the topography of the localities was not transparent because of mountainous valleys and because of the old road to a common topography.
For the next building season, the road section from the city of Daugavpils is to be restored to the reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, the LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
Information on all repairs planned for this year's national road network is available on the LVC website www.enceli.en.
"The correct choice of food combinations is crucial to achieving the desired weight reduction."
Moreover, it is easy to do so in the summer period, when fresh fruit, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A prudent combination of nutrition products can not only help to reduce overweight, but can also help to promote the various processes of the body in a targeted way.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, providing a lasting sense of salt and helping to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition Log have shown that the vinegar has a beneficial influence on the blood level and helps us feel cheerful.
Cocktail peaches and protein rich foods, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, produce not only a sense of salt, but also reduce the cards for large meals in the next food.
Such a combination of meals can also increase the quantity of calorie burned after meals to 35%.
Studies show that Cajenza pipets can help to get rid of the fat round in the area of the wind.
Ools contain a nutrient that contributes to metabolism, chin, while papric is a good source of vitamin C.
With the inclusion of sufficient quantities of this nutrient, the level of cortizol can be reduced, thus also the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
The yarn of oats, accompanied by fresh berries, is yet another thin and fats meal for breakfast, which is worth including on its menu.
The oranges and berries contain fibres which, according to Canadian scientists, are controlled by a greed - a deliberate incentivising hormone - and thus also by a sense of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols that are assists in weight reduction and do not allow the appearance of fat.
Vegetables and proteins can also do miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of generating a sense of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fibre, and therefore contribute to the sense of salt.
At the same time, protein slows down the digestive process and provides a long-term sense of salt.
They can eat a chicken with sweet chickens over lunch or make protein cocktails from a finished mixture and enjoy it with their favourite vegetables.
To avoid any product combinations.
There are sugars in the plants - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch contained in the vegetables is polyaccharide.
The fruit is broken up mechanically in the angle, while they do not divide chemically until they reach the third or fourth stage of the digestive process taking place in tears.
Starch is divided into three different stages, starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat sweet food immediately after the meal.
When you eat food straight after meals, it is trapped in a cork with other meals where it is not chemically digested and blown up.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers or other products containing carbohydrated carbohydrate, together with lemon, happiness, orange, or other acid fruit.
Ensigm of pthialine in nuts only works in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids prevent not only the remoteness of carbohydrates, but also encourage their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk, and combinations of products rich in similar protein in one meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each of which has different strength, characteristics and time when it has to enter the cork.
Archbishop, medmalone, musicone and other melons must always be eaten separately from other meals.
The Black is not digested if it is in the husband with other foods.
Far in combination with protein rich products.
Economies form a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fat hinders digesting of protein.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If large quantities of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid the use of fat at all.
This also applies to freshings - it is not advisable to combine large amounts of nuts (containing protein) with whole source cadados (containing fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How can we better prepare?
"Cooking, thermal treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients, estimated at 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the product," the diethology said.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste by boiling food in water.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods is increasing with the direct weakness of the product.
You can eat them later, after wearing a soup - you will not lose the nutrients left in the water in this case.
It is advisable to make the trees prepared by quoting them too.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of tomatoes.
In the case of tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of carbonate is increasing by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of the betacartine, found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, the heroes, the sweet potatoes and the spreads.
The thermal processing of eggs and meat deprives them of the natural characteristics of the proteins they contain, making them easier to digestible.
Similarly, the thermic treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other mineral substances contained in these products easier to absorb into the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while the freezing of the fibre is not affected.
Combination with tomatoes may increase the intake of iron into the body, which in turn ensures a better functioning of the brain and muscles.
Our body hosts up to 33% less non-blood iron found in plant products such as beans, foxes, cereal products, than the blood iron found in animal national products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood iron into the body by eating non-blood iron products together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blood iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
The Iron is needed for the production of chemoglobal, which ensures the delivery of oxygen in muscles and brains.
Add healthy fats such as olive or linseed oil to get the maximum benefit from sweets.
Add to butter bread with reading with D vitamins for wealthy salmon or sariards for a non-additive iofever, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium-absorbed calcium and plays an important role in the bone formation process.
Oats (as well as other grain products), combined with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, rivers, raspberries and other fruits or coal, help to stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid the melting of arteries.
Ssilchat Anime's effect is criticized for Asian caricature
Snapchat tells us that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators say it is racist insensitivity.
With this glaring effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their own identity in a very absurd way in their daily lives.
You can turn yourself into an anthem, a dog or an image of Roja Lihštenstein.
It is a flat, depictive tool that generates more than 30 million converted selphies per day.
Any error becomes apparent rapidly.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have already been criticised in the past, accusing it of promoting overly black or gay skins as an ideal benchmark of beauty.
New lenses were published this week, allowing users to draw their eyes, plates and footwear, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoons - the yellow gestures.
The question was also asked as to whether such inconsistencies do not suggest that the company has greater problems with diversity.
Negative news and public feeds burst on Wednesday, when the expenditures of The Verge and Motherboard said they had been taken out of the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lenses is to portray the image of Anime rather than caricature people of Asian origin.
However, those who have witnessed racism have been reminded of the painful stereotypes that exist.
Others categorically denied similarity to Anime.
Greisas Sparapani, an American art student of Korean origin, wrote in an email that was "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least."
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between azo cartoons and slow effects.
This shows that the slow effect is not just the yellow face, but the yellow face in terms of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company to fall into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use in our daily lives.
And the large audience of young people from different backgrounds, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
"Today, such things do not go unnoticed," Keitija Zou, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zou, the head of Medium's product, removed his app from the company and advised others to do the same.
In her article Medium and telephony interview, she explained that she believed that rabbit problems arise due to a employment policy of Ssilchat which there is insufficient support for racial diversity.
Zou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then closed its article with reference #DeleteSpetrochat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, which is why decisions are made in this way: are there some members of different races in the company, but they do not hold the position to be able to express their opinions safely and comfortably," according to the Chinese MEP Janou?
Her views are shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
It does not reveal how many employees come from different backgrounds, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but his spokesman found that the company had found a staff specialist who would concentrate on the representation of racial minorities who are not well represented and would facilitate their integration into the company.
For its part, Jou will not update his Snapchat account, adding: "Interest do they really need more users like us to realise that this is not right."
The Congress's chamber has announced that military officials have distorted reports of the Islamic State.
According to a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress's representatives of the US Central Command have distorted reports depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
Central command intelligence analysts are generally dissatisfied with the interim report by the Mission Unit set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence's Republican Representatives, pointing out that their leadership had control over reports of American successes in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Commitment, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report is that intelligence reports, approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders, are more positive in the fight against terrorism in the US than is the case, and the facts have been regularly distorted, reflecting better progress than other intelligence analyses have shown.
California's Republican spokesman Ken Kalverts tells MEPs: "Centcom is unacceptable: it is our soldiers who suffer if our policy-makers receive false reports."
Errors of management in Centcom are found in the top management of the organisation.
This ten-page long report illustrates in detail the problems that exist in terms of reflecting and analysing the Central Order's efforts by the Americans to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide compelling evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration would have distorted the reports, it shows that the Centcom management has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that during the first half of 2015, Central Administration press releases, communications and reports presented to Congress the situation in a considerably more positive light than was the case.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
Maik Pompeo, spokesman for the Republican Party, said in his report: "The investigation over several months clearly demonstrates this."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the main officials of the US Central Administration distorted the reports, depicting ISS risks to the weakest in Iraq than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being misled.
As the inquiry continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings on the matter.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence is conducting an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party working group.
Reporters Adams Shariff said in her report that from 2014 to 2015 Centcom had too limited the preparation of reports of intelligence assessments in relation to ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr Schifa explains that this process' stopped the dissemination of information ', worsened analysts' ethics and 'spread facts that were not in line with reality'.
But Shiff and Democratic Party members said there was no evidence that the White Nams had put pressure on the Centcom analysts to produce reports according to a "predetermined or political position."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress's investigation on Thursday.
In August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon's spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said that the Pentagon would not comment on the Congress's report while the investigations continued.
He also said that experts sometimes interpret complex data and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Administration are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (statement by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Administration's reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism regarding Islamic State reconnaissance is reminiscent of events more than ten years ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs Heusker released a study stating that the George W. Bush administration started a war in Afghanistan with too little thought for its possible consequences.
The club also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Christmas team found that, in contrast to public reports, air strikes at the Islamic State oil factories had not significantly contributed to the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil to the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not come out of the walls of Central Administration.
The Centcom commander, General Loids Ostins III, received sharp criticism at the time, as many lawmakers believed that the war reports were too positive to describe the situation.
In April General Ostins retired and replaced General Jozeff L. Votels.
The United States wins the United States, winning the fourth consecutive victory in the Hemicycle Female Hockey in Britain.
Keitija Bam scored the first two goals for the US Women's Field hockey team on Thursday after winning Japan with a 6-0 win victory.
The five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bama said she could not remember whether she had ever succeeded in doing so.
She said, 'I have no idea'.
I am not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the American result at the Olympic Games is 4: 0, giving them in their group undivided with Britain, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with a 2: 0 victory.
Britain and the US will meet on Saturday to play the first match of the game.
The two teams are already qualified for the fourth quarter finals, and the game will only determine which team will take first place in the six-team group and whose second.
The winner of the first prize will no longer be able to meet with a strong Dutch version, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the Saturday match does not extend, the Americans have already called a storm of surprise, taking the last place in London four years ago between 12 teams.
Bama was also on the team
She grew up in Bwabelt, the field hockey wall was first picked up by her daughter nurse at 3 years old (her oldest daughters were already working with this sport in Ddex) and joined the national sample when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the history.
She was not for the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not enter the final.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
Next year, English Krega Parcham was appointed as the coach and everything changed for the better.
He called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
In London, we did not put as much work as we did now.
We have changed everything.
On Thursday, Bama unveiled the result by winning the first half of the first half with a rear foot from a close distance.
India started the game without winning its account, but their selection was very rigid and kept to a minimum at the end of the period 0: 1 to 3, when Bama was reneged.
She started her debut in the area on the left side of the square, then went to the middle of the square and put her finger in a 2-0 lead by the American side.
In the mid-fourth period, Melisa Gonzalesa gained one more goal.
This was the first game of the U.S. goalkeeper in Bruges, with each of the first three matches in one goal.
She is running out.
And Bama as well.
"We're going very well now," Paschams said, but how good it is will show the game on Saturday.
Depressing food is the only meal that can be used for depression
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklins Delano Rubtlet sat in an ovral to hold a meal.
President Rinpoche had a splendid gastronomy, such as a gesture of geese, or a sooner and a sun of Merilland turtles.
However, the meal was much more modest then: the egg of tomatoes, the potato thickengrass and the dessert a flash.
James Ziegelmane says: 'This is a way of showing solidarity in cooking with people who have been very hard off'.
Her husband, Andris Costa, adds: 'This is also a message to the Americans how to eat'.
A couple of Brooklyn Heights District is a food historians.
The latest book, "Dry of Vegetables," describes Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelmane, in his book "97 Orange," describes the life through the meal house in Manhattan's east.
Their new joint work on "The Sulphur meal," which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is about an American meal during the Easter Depression.
By showing some solidarity in the culinary, they held a meal together with a reporter Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple dinner in a building located in the area of Flatiron, operating from 1929, when the great depression began.
Ms Ziegelmanes, 54, ordered butter with a melted cheese and captured olives, while the 57 year-old Kou ordered a turkey, potato thick and vegetable ice.
When he ordered a fake lady, the couple said that his choice was very appropriate to talk about the Easter Depression Day.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said that the fake birds were very popular.
There was a land nut chicken, a liver lake and a flower lake.
They were made of the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is - eat so many peanuts to be at lunch.
Mr Kou was shouting.
"It seemed that the wind was full of lead," he said.
In the years of predepression, the table for the American lunch was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat their men's workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were presented with fresh bits.
During the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans food, describing how the Americans adapted to the circumstances in which America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, the diet became the main focus of the American people in everyday life," says Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write on this particular subject.
The new budget diet became just as significant: unknown meals such as a fake chicken and indignation became daily, indignation was an "excellent way to use surpluses," said Mrs Ziegelmanes, as the coats could conceal the unattractive ingredients under a harsh measure.
The fruits were replaced by cheap fruit.
The meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, unseen formations were born.
In an old book, Mrs Ziegelmanes found a recipe for making peanuts filled with peanuts.
Mr Kok adds: 'It was not a popular addition to the dinner table'.
Mrs Ziegelmanes stresses' It was surreal '.
A peanuts butter and a tiny butter are not compatible.
Many home food recipes applied to difficult times.
Domestic economists such as Luise Stenley, head of the Federal Office for the Economics of Household from 1923 to 1943, laid down national eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economists" and to take on challenges such as converting the macaron and carrot mixture into a spiritual meal.
The St Maltinte is a sleepy of historical spirits.
Evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens is particularly interesting, such as President Herbert Harver, let me eat the cake.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and food in Aiova, he was actually eating like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kok tells us: 'He liked Europe's cucumber cucumber, for example.'
He was eating in an almost golden waiter wearing lunch jacket.
He was completely removed from reality.
President Ruerot would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not recommended that he set an example by his eating habits.
The book said they had a domestic worker who did not teach to cook, so the White House became the place where "not only one of the least spiritual meals in Washington was presented, but also the worst prepared meals."
As soon as the country's economy recovers, most of the depression era parasites disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrients and how to use science in gastronomy, said Mrs Ziegelmanes.
The couple tells us that, in writing, they gained a greater understanding of the dietary habits of Mrs Ziegelmanes, for example, why she was unable to throw away food.
"She was really afraid to throw away the food," said Mr Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said: 'She was actually infuriating people'.
There was once an incident with wind cake.
When we had eaten in the estuary of Eisenberg, a couple of writers pulled down a dessert made from the Finnish home: a flash puppet that President Rucant used to eat at at lunch.
"It is a flash pupil," said Mrs Ziegelmanes, adding that at the time there was a widespread habit of giving a splendid menu to moderate meals.
It does not contain cream, only dried plates, a little meal, sugar, water and a cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently immersed the wounds in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it was not that bad.
Mr Kou eaten a few more crocoes.
Listening to a experienced "economist," he said to his wife: "A wife of a dried skiped."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for the Hepatitis C patent
A district judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the costs of lawyers "services it has paid in the case of the Breaking of the Hepatitis C patent against the company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted for a fine of 200 million pounds for breaking two Merck patents, which threatened it with the successful Sostini and Harvoni tablets, when a federal judge in the US found irregularities in Merk's operations, such as shooting after the oath transfer and other unethical acts.
In a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Fummen said that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses he has incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to gain market positions against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C medicines, which is effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was already launched in 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sopbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead's medicine.
The US-backed forces said they had fully taken control of the city of Manbidya from the Islamic State.
The US-backed forces have fully taken control of the city of Manbidya in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the latest Islamic State militants have left the city, the group spokesman said Friday.
Syrian Democratic Force (SDS) is currently cleaning the city from the latest opponents who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2 000 hostages held by fighters, the military council of the SDS's Manbidier military council told Reuters.
"The city is now under our full control and we are searching for fighters," he told Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton issued a 2015 tax declaration on Friday, showing that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid the federal tax rate at 34.2 percent.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to his Clinton charity, while former President Bill Clinton earned around $5.3 million, speaking as a spokesman and a former state secretary with 3 million dollars from his book of work in the State Departamena, published in cooperation with Simon & NLE ster.
Clinton's ally, US state Senator Tims Kein and his wife Anna Holtone have published his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tims Kein continue to set new standards of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palun said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind various pretexts and reservations so as not to keep his promises of disclosure of his tax information.
The publication of outstanding tax information is a practice in the record for US presidential candidates, but this is not required by law.
Trump and his lawyers cite the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your march," Clinton's campaign partner, Ian Sams, said in his Twitter inaugural inaugural inaugural inaugural edition of the Democratic Party candidate's tax information.
Trump's special advisor Michael Kohlíček said Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before audits are completed.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mour Romney and other Republican voters in 2012, claim that his refusal raises questions about his true extent of property, donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton filed the oil with a video on Friday calling on Trump to publish his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during her economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico says that for two years in the 1990s Trump has paid very little or no tax and on Friday, the author of the New York Times said that many accountants and lawyers believed that nothing had changed today.
Federal tax rates are a fundamental issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the billionaire Varena Bafeta's proposal, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than USD 1 million per year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, when Clinton appeared in Omah, Nebrak, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate was also present, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
He is also being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton now lives in Chaga, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 tax survey on Clinton shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are paid.
Their main investment was the low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

The director of Jewish films criticises the hotel in Berlin for breaking off Israel's long-distance negotiating code at the request of an Arabic - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin raised a storm on social media after he discovered that Kempinski Bristol was not available at a hotel in Berlin on the Israeli remote conversation code, which was based on a demand from Arab clients.
Klods Lancmans, director of the Shoah Holocaust, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Hotel of Kempinski Bristol in Berlin and addressed an open letter to German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman attempted to find an Israeli remote negotiation code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, the country was not included in the list of countries to which the hotel number can be called directly.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, in the new German capital, Israel has been massacred and destroyed?
Tom Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call the country through its call centre.
He asked for clarification from the hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer received was "shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "this was an informed decision by the management of the hotel."
The reason for taking the code was even more infuriating to the film maker.
"Most guests are Arabs and they demanded the eviction of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes a hotel worker's explanation.
Sudanese deutsche Zeitung said the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakovs Hadas-Handelsman, called this case 'great shame'.
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany is an even greater humiliation on this very hotel network.
Clarifications are not required.
He said, "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
The event also received quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply natural for Arab customers.
Another record said it was "shameful," pointing out that the hotel was on the streets of Kurfurstendamm beside synagogy.
Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself was quick to reject all accusations, saying it was "misunderstanding" and apologised to Lancmanam.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," the Kempinski representative cites Sudan deutsche Zeitung.
And it adds that the code was added again to the list.
The police are using rubber bullets and tear gas against Brazilian students who are protesting.
A collision between students and police took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students demonstrated against government reforms of education systems.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to evict students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The proposal by São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmina is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators marked the wall with messages against interim President Michael Temeru.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to support the suspended president Dym Rousefai, whose impeachment was voted by an ancient.
Scotland's Schiners finishing first, bringing Britain into cycling gold medals
The first men's bicycle race in Rio, which took place last night, was held by the British team, which secured its champion at the London Games in 2012.
The 23-year-old player from Glasgow played an important role in these matches, making the legendary Scottish Shou Hoc proud and winning supporters New Zealand.
Britain won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals four years ago.
And they also repeated it at the London World Cup, even though Holy had already graduated from his career as a athlete.
The problems were in the phase between the Beijing and London Olympics because of the need to replace the experienced Start Expert, James Stafu.
They succeeded in doing so at the last minute.
When Holy left, he tried to fill his seat in Kian Emadi and Met Krampton.
British trainers had hopes of the Skiner, seeing his potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who started four years ago with Hoe and Skiner, who installed the Olympic Skiner record, but the race was better for New Zealand
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindes were tight in their circles, Kenny came to the leadership and Skiners protected that leadership.
The change of strategy has played an important role in winning, since Hindu has travelled with more carry-overs to allow Kenya, and the Skinson in particular, to travel faster.
The Hoy watched the match as a representative of the BBC and a watchdog of Skinera, Kenya and Hindesa's eye at the time they went on a trap to the floor.
The 23-year-old glacier said, 'This was an unspeakable honour'.
I am doing everything to defend my name.
We set up an Olympic record and winning the World Cup in the top.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better victory.
Hindes said Hindes was deliberately dropping on his way to the game after the failed start, along with Kenyan and Hoch at the London Olympics in 2012.
Later, he refuted this comment and British competitors did not have the power to prove the opposite.
This time there were no such incidents.
Hindes said: "The British flags in the tribes remembered London."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Cup championships, so a victory at the Olympic Games was indeed special.
One medal will be marched by a country that won seven of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of teamprogress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of Holy in obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenry, this would mean six pieces of gold and one silver medal, and, moreover, Kenya was born on 23 March (it looks like it is the British sacrosanct date, because it was also born that day by Steve Nurit, Mo Farach and Roger Banisters).
Holy was born on that date as well.
Kenya is the sprint that starts today and continues for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I just enjoy it now.
A circle journey is always the best.
Because then you can win with our teammates.
To be honest, to win one is a little alone. "
Hindes said: 'If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed in arms control'.
On that day it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bremliy, Ed Klensij, Steve Burks and Ovein Douls showed the fastest qualifying time to take four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World Record, set up in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and finals will take place in the second half of the day today, where Viins will certainly be in the spotlight.
Yesterday, before a qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the comarioate when the judges summoned him to measure his height.
The women's journey, which will continue and conclude today, brought a new record time of 4: 13.260 for the Laura Trot, Janna Rovselland Shanda, Elinora Barker and Keitija Archibald from Milngavia.
The British delegation hopes that the British bicycle driving team, the cafe, will fight medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same progress to be made in Rio as well.
Meanwhile, he has gone through the scenes in different ways, after accusations of sexism and insulting dignity, the technical director, Sheins Satons, resigned, and the career is also finished by Holy and Victor Bendleton.
However, as the first bicycle race begins, it seems that Britain will, as always, reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Battlegroup is becoming uncertain because an ambitious treaty is being stopped.
Aluminium slaughterhouses and the future of hundreds of its employees in Portland, Viktoria, have become uncertain, as its main client, the energy company, has announced the suspension of cooperation.
This statement is based on plans by the government of Victoria to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20 years of subsidies will be suspended in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be under threat.
In addition, it will also have unforeseeable side-effects, as the slaughterhouse consumes around 10 percent of the whole of Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the "Point Henry" slaughterhouse, which led to the decommissioning of the Angleseas power plant.
Alkoas Portland's slaughterhouse is working with losses and can be shut down.
These events have been the result of years of speculation over the increasing value of the Australian dollar and the cost of plant production.
The company's energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Ilie, says that it is likely that the other three owners will also terminate their contracts.
The majority of power plants are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia joint venture, with Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp carrying companies in addition to the company's parts.
"AGL" hopes that the Portland plant will continue operating, which would mean a future energy supply at a slaughterhouse, "said the spokesman.
AGL said the contracts were so-called "risk-limiting contracts," which are due to enter into force as of November 2016.
Contracts have a 12 months period of validity and will therefore run until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenues from these contracts also in 2017 in the fiscal year, "said the company's representative.
From 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already recorded losses of more than $187 million in its forecasts, predicting that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating or supply energy to a slaughterhouse.
The US company reported that in 2010 it concluded an agreement with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it will be suspended in November; the company does not explain why it will cut off cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns both about the alleged closure of the Portland slaughterhouse in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the sector's weak economy.
AGL CEO Steve Mikelson said last week that the analysts estimate that 600 megavatus and Tomago 900 megavatus energy were used in the course of Portland.
If these two plants were to leave the energy market then energy demand would fall considerably.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
The claims of more than 160 000 people are rejected each year and, as the budget decreases, the situation could get worse.
Three out of five people in Windland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal evictions - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the reduction in funding will only make the situation worse.
As early as June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than in the past.
James Farels, Director of the Legal Centre of Capcine Leave, said that the latest Association Report of the National Legal Centres said that legal aid is currently being refused to thousands of people in need.
The Minister, Mr Farel, pointed out that if this decision is not lifted, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre of Windland is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are refused help'.
People who seek to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are being unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands more people in Windland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Cavalland Senator, George Brandisa, to immediately stop cutting funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now it is also time for attention to be paid to the needs of local communities and their customers and for the Government of Palazčuka to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign has been taken to court because one of the staff has been fired from a gun
New York: The organisers of the Donald Trump campaign have been taken to court because they have not taken action after receiving information that their North Millionaire Operation Manager has opened a firearm against a worker when they have travelled in one car in February.
The incident was described in court actions brought by Vincent Bordini, a former campaigner, to the Sharlotes court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for an internal examination of the case, but understood that this would not happen.
Leader David Filips "pulled up the pistol, put his good scorer on the meat and opened the barrel to the end of the run of Dr Medveta," Bordini says in his complaint.
He also claims that by making complaints to local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini knew that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"The weapons do not have to be shot to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was put forward, the Republican candidate for the presidential post caused a scandal, saying people could take action if Hillary Clinton wins the election and elected judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media had broken his words from the context and had never instigated anyone into violence.
Bordini wants to recover compensation from campaign organisers for negligent monitoring and from the Philippines for the attack, the illegal use of a weapon and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's spokesman Hix did not comment immediately.
It has not been possible to communicate with the Philippines.
WCCB, the local news agency of Sharlotes, reports that the Philippines has recently left the campaign.
Nor has he managed to call his consultancy "Innovative Consultation Services."
Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - the rainy and sports festivities in the Khartoum.
On Saturday, for the first time in Khartoum, people gathered for the festive and sports festivals.
After 10 years of celebration, it was decided this time that Eger's festival would no longer exist.
A new page has been broken down.
The day began with sporting competitions.
This time the game was not traditional and too serious because, for example, the horrors had to be dropped in the wealthy purpose, the boot airport, the daughter of the human left, the bumbol, has not been in any of the Olympic Games at all.
However, each participant could demonstrate how strong, courageous, successful and committed he is.
After the sport matches, everyone gathered in an open-air service, where the celebrations began.
In the meantime, there was also a 'children's corner' where the small people could burst into the tortuous excavation and get a new face from the shadows.
A new thing, which could also become a tradition, was a show of the driving gear in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
Inga Kadiče-Skadina, head of the commander of the Khartoum command, who ordered nice rest and dry time, was raining but could not do much.
The nightmare continued with the wearing of the youngest inhabitants of Ceuta.
Indeed, it is good that the carpet has enriched five girls and one teenage.
The gamblers had a multitude of amateur arts from the Engures' square - the audience very much liked the "Rudens rites" of the ancient dance, the performances of the various peoples' dance at the Rda, and the golden priceberg of young people.
Nothing happened to slip on the wet scene.
Of course, the local people and the villages were happy to have the famous star Janis Jarans and Dainis Porgant, who once again served as a Pole of Milan Pole and Clear Creana, as well as the captive wives of Burzcier from fishermen's backyard 'Days'.
The Brugant group played the ballots.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, I think, makes Heathrow very attractive, as it was in London in 2012, where we put an enormous amount of work into making all the regions of the country profit from the Olympic Games.
There was a huge amount of controversy and discovery from the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be people here who believe that this challenge is too great and that Heathrow's expansion is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never succeed in preparing for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global failure.
The Nephrops were wrong for 2012 and, in Heathrow, they would not be right either.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole and not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth amounting to 211 billion, paving the way for employment and experience at the airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow has a great team, which has created an investment programme of 11 billion pounds for infrastructure, starting in time and with a budget of 5 from the terminal, which, five years from the site, has been named the best airport terminal in the world and ending with a terminal 2, which has been built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to create a third runway, which will be funded with a private investment of EUR 16 billion.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success and I am sure that this will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow by securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Managing Board of Heathrow and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman turns on a superior road in an attempt to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, it was on the grand road.
The police are trying to find witnesses to an accident where she was crossing several cars early on the early morning of Thursday.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near Morges in Vo Canton.
The State Police report says that in desperately wanting to commit suicide, a woman had grown on the road in the dark where several cars had reached her.
Clearly, in an attempt to kill themselves, victims, 49 year old ushers, came together several cars, including the heavy machinery.
She died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others have not yet been identified, says the police calling for the drivers and witnesses to the accident involved.
In the case, a criminal investigation has also been launched, which is a logical step in this case, a lawyer Gilles Hofstellers said in a statement in Le Voune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers added, "I will find that out to the public prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, a pedestrian had fled to the middle of night, so it was decided that drivers could not be expected to have a pedestrian in the middle of night on the highway, a newspaper said.
Last year a policeman was acquitted for killing after neglect when she travelled in August 2014 to a man who lay in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The Court found that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and later came to sleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policeman who was on the way to the scene of an accident came in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and that the judge admitted that the wearing man on the road was a 'completely unpredictable and exceptional case'.
Anyone with information on the incident near Morges on Thursday is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
The Internet collects signatures to organise a new competition for the head of the Revenue Service.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" launches the collection of signatures to organise a competition for the new head of the State Revenue Service (Revenue Service).
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Union (Nation) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (Greens / Farmers), points out that the public wants a transparent and professional process for nominating officials.
The petition was set up on 10 August and has now been signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing Ingas Kolegova as Director General of the Revenue Service is untransparent and unprofessional.
This is reminiscent of the best functional tradition of the Soviet Union.
It discredits the administration of the state and once again frustrates society in government and politics.
"There is a need for a contest with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," the text of the petition said.
Its author, Janis B., pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria for selecting Kolegova for the post.
Nor is it clear what the candidate's intentions are for the Revenue Service.
According to the petition, the State Chancellery should launch a new, open competition, with professional candidates, recruitment experts and adequate remuneration.
Finance minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova as head of the Revenue Service last week, but all Unity ministers voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, so I played badly.
Alexander Samoilovs and Janis Shonins were hoping for the Rio Olympics, but without it there is no difference between closing competitions, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the strongest beaches in the world on Thursday lost to the Brazilian Evandra Gonsalveam Oliveiru and Pedra Solbergon, with 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15) at a four-year sports forum.
The Latvian athletes won one win in three games, but the same was the same for two more couples.
The relationship between the small points of three couples was further counted, the most unfavourable of Latvia's double-point after the convincing loss in the match.
"We were in the lead in the first sixth, but out of 16: 15 we kept the game for 16 points," Schmins said.
I do not even know how we stayed without points in the remaining part of the sixth.
It cannot play like this.
After that, everything was in order and on the face of the face managed to break the game and it should have been a good basis for the third.
We started it in a similar way, but after we changed the parties, the result was only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group all the teams were alike, with three shots in almost all matches, so the small points were important.
"We should have played more like that than giving 3-4 points in a row," he said.
We know that Evandra can be preserved.
"We had 1-2 points in the first half, and the third match to + 4 had already been played for him," Schuman said.
We tried to show the best game.
They came together, sometimes not.
I did not see the situation before the match, but I knew there were as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, so I played badly," Samoilovs said.
We waited for a good sergeant from Evandra and in the first faces of it, but the third one opened up to him and it was difficult for him to carry out an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistake in taking on the Pedra serves in particular, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilovs said that, contrary to the previous match today, athletes had no nervous.
"We played, we played, there was protection, but there was a need for better reception," he said.
"They played well and in the end got to the urra."
Before the tournament we said straight away that it was the least convenient that could have been.
We also had the chance to fight for first place, but we did not even come out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for the medals and we too were waiting for ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilovs, who predicted that the dozens would continue to play together in the future.
I think that there will not be a question and that we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov was already in his third Olympic career at Rio de Janeiro in 2008, as he was joined by Martin Prison in Beijing in 2008, but four years ago he played with Ruslana Sorokin in in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second start of the Olympics for Shonins.
Latenergo also follows the process of opening up the gas market from a potential trader's position.
Latvian energy company Latvijas energo is following the process of opening up the gas market, both from the consumer's position and the position of potential trader, said the company's spokesperson Ivita Bidere.
"The decision as to whether in the future Latvia energo will also join the gas market as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be established."
"We are therefore actively involved on our part in the legislative process and in our comments and proposals," Bidere said.
BNS has already written that the Economics Ministry, in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the Latvian Gas company, has drawn up a draft Cabinet of Ministers' rules on the marketing and use of natural gas, which will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, guaranteeing natural gas customers the right to choose freely the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
As part of the regulatory work on the new natural gas market, the objective of the EM is to make the trade in natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly servicing option, the "central model" of the trader has been chosen, where all customer service activities are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one point of provision of information and customer service, leaving the technical aspects of the natural gas distribution system to the discretion of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We recall that household customers will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price after 3 April 2017.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas related customers at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
On the other hand, economic operators will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of a natural gas contract, an economic operator will be able to trade natural gas at a fixed price.
The Cabinet of Ministers' rules set out in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall establish arrangements for the supply to and the termination of natural gas by customers, requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified asset in the supply and use of natural gas; arrangements for settling the services received, the interest for delay, switching procedures and the supply of customers in the event of a disruption of natural gas supply; and the supply of natural gas to associated customers by the public seller.

Minister: next week, the Revenue Service's director-general is expected to increase his remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers) plans next week to talk with Prime Minister Mars Kuchinski (Greens / Farmers) and government coalition partners about increasing the salaries of the State Revenue Service's director-general.
Reizniece-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Revenue Service's director-general needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency in order to make the post more attractive to potential new tenderers.
There will also be talk next week about changing the terms of the competition.
She also said she had no thought of a specific candidate to apply for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola said Inga Kolegova, head of the National Environment Service, would have been a good director of the Revenue Service.
On the other hand, as regards the current chief of the Revenue Service, Daci Pelsel, who was ready to apply for the post, the minister reiterated that the new Revenue Service director-general should be a "face to face" and should not come from the Revenue Service's structure.
She also said she was waiting for Saeima to return from the leave to steer the amendments to the law needed for the reorganisation of the Revenue Service as soon as possible.
The agency BNS reported that Inga Kolegova, head of the National Environment Service, submitted an application to the Minister for Finance, Danai Reiznie-Ozoka (Greens / Farmers) withdrawing his candidacy for the Revenue Service's Director General.
She said in her application that it was not an easy choice, but that her relatives have been under serious emotional pressure in the last two weeks without having taken any legislative action.
Kolegova also pointed out that discussing her candidacy has heightened controversy among the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
As reported, Inar Petertersone, the former director-general of the SRS, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indices in the US and in Europe are on the rise, as well as the value of the US dollar.
World oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors' sentiment having a positive impact on the statements by Saudi oil minister, which reinforces expectations that the biggest oil producer countries will act to stabilise the global oil market at the OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached a record high on Thursday, which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of a number of large companies.
The rise in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also led to a rise in European stock exchange indexes.
The dollar has increased on Thursday in relation to the euro, the British pound and the Japanese jen.
In September, the price of crude oil for deliveries rose by USD 1.78 to USD 43.49 per barrel.
The price of crude oil for deliveries on the London exchange in October increased by $1.99 to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the canning manufacturer 'Blue lagoon' fell by 33. 8% last year.
The turnover of the canning manufacturer Blue salt last year was EUR 4.202 million, which is 33. 8% less than in the past, and the company's losses fell 5.7 times to EUR 904.7 000, according to the annual financial report published by the Lursoft database.
According to the company's management report, in 2015, the company worked on losses caused by several reasons, including the persistent lack of working resources caused by Unicredit Bank leaving the Baltic market, ending the previously existing credit line and leaving the Blue lagoon with concluded contracts without any possibility to enforce them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials on a large scale and to receive a discount.
The Latvian bank's withdrawal from the market also prevented the company from implementing EU structural fund support projects, which would have allowed the factory to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Similarly, the financial producers of the company were negatively affected in the past year by the rise in the price of raw materials and the lack of willingness on the part of customers to pay more for the products produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers admitted price changes and were ready to purchase goods at the new, higher, prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, the Blue lagoon also opened discussions with potential investors, including the evaluation of movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been in the company's largest lender Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have been familiar and negotiating possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation in practice of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
The plan included improving and optimising the technological processes, which can achieve greater productivity and capacity in production.
"A number of facilities were bought, allowing a higher speed of production," the company's management said.
"In 2016, the equipment purchased will allow the company's production facility to carry out orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since a record of intent on selling a product has already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the declarations of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by around €300 000 per month, "the company's management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, the first experimental container was sent to Israel, extended the market to Cyprus and signed a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US in September this year.
As a result of all the above measures, the company intends to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Blue lagoon worked with EUR 6.347 million in turnover and EUR 5.113 million in losses.
The Blue lagoon was founded in 1997 with a share capital of €1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals, Mikhail Kaidanovam (89. 11%) and Igor Šyrini (10. 89%).
Welcome to the museum, the magazine's star Leanderi and to the press conference.
The city of Zar Leanderes, a noble cinema, can be considered to be the city of noble cinema and inspiration.
The fate of Zar Lenderes's village at a cross mother, Mrs Ruta, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, became common in Riga in 1924, because it was she who unveiled the unusual low contress of Zar Leanderes's woman, who she tried to defeat on the theatre stage of the Riga pocket.
Maybe it was by chance that the nightmare in Riga became the fatal turning point on the creative road of Zar towards the world's massacre.
Riga Leandeen has had warm memories and she was hoping to come to Riga in tyranny, but unfortunately it was not doomed to live up because the Second World War began.
Using the play form, the event will be possible during Riga celebrations 2016 and the distinguished role of Zar Leanderes will be felt by the great Ava Kervica.
In the vicinity of Aglona, there are broad traffic restrictions.
With a view to ensuring the safety of the most holy participants in the entries in the New York Maria Debeki, between 17: 00 and 15 August this year, transit freight traffic will be shut down on several national motorways around Aglona, the Latvian State Routes of WAS reported.
Aglona festive members and public transport will not be subject to these restrictions.
It should be borne in mind that only public transport and pedestrians will be able to pass through the construction and construction site on the Aglona festival from Cruslava to the Kruslava station (0.80-4.00km).
For other road users, traffic will be provided on the driveway - the file attached to the scheme.
Traditionally, a large number of participants are arriving for these holidays, including holy travellers.
This is why motorists need to be particularly careful because there will be an intensive pedestrian movement on various motorways towards Aglona.
We call on drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions imposed, to respect traffic organisation arrangements and to count on a possible longer time spent.

Kurdish activists use the German public broadcaster's house.
A group of 30 Kurdish people took over a public broadcaster WDR building in Diselseldorf on Thursday evening, where a protest campaign was held for almost two hours, German police said.
The demonstrators who came with posters with them were sounding various slogans, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
According to officials, the demonstration was generally peaceful and protesters left the building voluntarily at the request of the workers.
The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on Wednesday cancelled flights at the airport.
If insurance paid to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga airport on Wednesday 10 August, it had to cancel the scheduled music festival visit.
On 11 August, if a customer was insured, an application for redress was received.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but as it was not possible to do so because of flights cancelled at the airport on Wednesday, a consumer's reimbursement of night bookings, which could not be cancelled any more, was calculated, as well as the purchase of a festival ticket amounting to €204.
On the other hand, the airline has promised to reimburse the money spent on airline tickets.
If on average, insurance from all travel insurance benefits has paid compensation for interruption or cancellation of a journey in 15% of cases.
"At such times, costs are reimbursed for buying, giving or exchanging tickets, as well as accommodation booking," said Dagija Rutka, head of the Insurance Personnel's insurance product.
As we know, in the evening of 10 August, a private aircraft crashed on Riga because of technical problems, so only a number of departing flights were cancelled, but a number of incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
As a result of a neighbouring repair, a man is being forced to leave his house to the printing ceiling.
Dmitry Saidjašev, a neighbour of the capital refurbished in his apartment, had turned to Dmitry Nov. 4, and since then is not sure that it is safe for Dmitry to stay in the house.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and there is a damaged ceiling in my apartment.
Then I informed the Riga Building Board, the House Manager and other organisations.
The Construction Board said that we are not any operational service and that we do not have any expertise.
"The living owner must go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry said.
The guest expert arrived in an unsatisfactory situation and found the cover unsatisfactory.
However, a month has passed on the construction board of the first Dmitry application and, by the beginning of this week, nobody was able to answer whether the location of the apartment was life-threatening.
In the Board of Construction you said - that is legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager back to the construction board, and then there is an impasse," Dmitry said.
After looking at the whole paperwork, it is clear that construction works have been stopped, even though it can be heard that someone is working there.
All these defects need to be corrected within two months and within six months for the apartment holder who is carrying out the repairs.
An independent expert has drafted his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this unpromising construction has been affected, so it is not certain that the lower apartment owner is being put at risk.
"We have therefore asked for further clarification from this expert," Ilze Zuka, spokesman for the Riga City Construction Board, told reporters.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, there is increasing evidence from there that construction is ongoing.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without construction permission is between €70 and €700, but in this case the penalty can be much more severe.
While awaiting an expert opinion, the construction board decided that both apartments should not be exploited, both in which construction takes place and in Dmitry's apartments.
"This is an unprecedented event in the practice of the construction board that, in this way, citizens may have been put at risk not only in their own property but also in their lower ownership, as a result of this inability to operate their property," said a spokesman for the construction board.
Now Dmitry remains to seek another place to live in, to live by relatives, friends, in a hotel or to rent another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover the losses incurred from a neighbour by civil law, which can take a lot of time.
As a result of arbitrary construction, both apartments are now banned until a civil engineer delivers a conclusion, and this may have to be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
This is due to the fact that the construction board's words have not been taken into account, which also threatens prison sentences of up to six months.
Come on!

The transformation of the former bucket sanatorium into five stars at hotels will cost EUR 22 million.
The conversion of the former Kemeru Sanatorium into a five-star hotel at Park Hotel Kemeri will cost EUR 22 million, Gita Želve, spokesman for the future hotel manager Park Hotel Kemeri, told LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage in the reconstruction of the former ambulance of Kemers.
The second phase will be "wellness" or well-being clinics, which will be opened in 2022, while the launch of the hotel is scheduled to take place in May 2018.
"The costs of precise clinics are still unknown.
However, she points out that it will be located in a pollyline building of the former Kemerar resort with an area of about 12 000 square metres.
The line will be in three stages.
Park Hotel Kiremeri and the expected holder of the clinics are the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in Europe's assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are a number of investors investing in the fund, he said.
As the CEO of G Capital Europe said earlier, George James, is expected to invest between €12 and €15 million in the creation of a former resort polical, totalling over €30 million.
As reported, in the renovation of the cultural park of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of access routes and street stages, the construction of an interactive natural tourist facility, the development of the area and the construction of car parks in Emite Prestige, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the town of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jurmala City Council intends to mobilise EUR 14.5 million from EU funds to co-finance EUR 14 million.
By mid-2017, design works will start in autumn next year.
As reported, a five-star hotel Park Hotel Kemeri and "wellness" will be set up in the incumbent Kemeri complex.
However, the reconstruction took longer.
The 2010 annual report also stated that Ominasis was regularly communicating with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide day-to-day technical control at the Kemeri hospital, and will certainly have a "completed reconstruction" of the future Hotel Kemeri and immediately launch the preparatory work to open the Kempinski chain hotel in 2011.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Kemeri, a month later, was declared unsuccessful as the winner had not paid for the purchase at the auction.
The sale price was set at the last price of the outstanding auction at EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA was informed by the City Council's spokesperson, Lieva Aile, the local government, has confirmed with the protocol that the co-funding of the European Union's structural funds will replicate the infrastructure, which will rebuild the historic Kemeru park, create an interactive natural tourism site, cleaning roads and car parks.
The President will present the Three Stars' Order to the organiser, Antoenko.
President Raimonds Vejonis to award the 3rd class of Fellow Order of Fellow to Alexander Antoenko next week, according to the President's agenda.
The award ceremony of the three Stars' Order will take place in the Black Guard House at 1300 CET.
According to the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antońsk graduated in 1998 at the Musics College of John Thatcher, where he studied a game of hardware instruments and learned to sing at Margarita Graso.
Student in the Vítola College of Latvian Music at the Academy of Arcle Luste.
In 1997, the Latvian National Opera Cork started to sing, while in 1998 he defeated the role played by Gerto in G.F.Hendele Opera Alčina.
He received the "Grand Music Award 2003" for a vocal performance in opera and Verdi Rekvim.
During the 2004 / 05 season, Latvia has become the most internationally recognised tenderer of the world's largest operatives.
Since autumn 2004 he has been singing 'Diseldorfas Deutsche Oper am Rhein', Berlin and Graz opera, Dresdenes' Semperoper ', Oslo and Stockholm Royal Operations, London Koventile, Montexarlo Opera, Vienna State Opera, as well as Geneva, Drresden and Diseldorfz Opera and Salzburg.
He was defeated with great success in 2009 in the role of Metropolitan Operation Prince.
In 2011, Antoenko, with Rikardo Muti and Chicago's Symphony Orchestra, sworn the title Otello at the Paris Operation, in Koventgate's opera, sworn Luidi in a youth study and in Stockholm he took part in the book Loja in the West.
A year later, Antoination has been a great success in the role of Otello in the London Coventans' Operation.
Russian hackers broke the email after former NATO commander Ban Ki-moon broke the email.
Hakers who hacked the computers of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) have allegedly carried out a number of other cyber attacks, including the email of the former NATO commander, Filipa Bladlova, and the Open Forces at George Sorosa Institute, the business news agency Bloomberg said Thursday.
Hakers' information has been published on the DCLeaks.com website.
It also contains correspondence with Wardlova and details of the work of the Sorosa Institute.
For Hakers the Institute's computers were available for a whole year.
According to the Bloomberg news, these cyber attacks have been carried out by the same hackers linked to Russian special services who blew DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the Obama administration is currently considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the intrusion of DNC computers.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have to formally prosecute Russia or the hauliers supported by the Russian authorities in a cyber attack on Democratic Party servers.
As reported, WikiLeaks published an estimated 20 000 emails from the DNC computer system in July, from which the leaders of the Democratic Party sought to undermine the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's former brother Vermont Senator Bernie Sandersa for his nomination to the presidential election.
As reported by the US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which is conducting an investigation into the shooting up of democratic servers, as well as other US special services, believe that Russia's links with cyber attacks are almost indisputable.
Macartnium: Joko Ono's presence endangered The Beatles.
Joko Ono's presence has created a sense of danger for the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74 year-old rock star is currently maintaining "good" relations with the width's widow of John Lenon, but she was afraid of Macartnia when she went to visit the group when she was in the record because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harison, Ringo Star, Lenone and Macarias.
When asked about the two relationships, he told Rolling Stone magazine: "It's really good."
We were in danger at that time.
While we were in the record, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate this.
We were able to do that, but we were not very successful because we were very tense.
We were not sexist, but girls usually did not get a record study, they let us work.
When John started meeting Joko, she did not sit in the checkroom, but in our four midst.
The author of Yellow Submarine also admitted that he is now in regular contact with Ringo, a former member of the group, and confirms the record curriculum from time to time, but otherwise the "The Beatles" has "ceased working."
Asked if he still met with the other only member of the legendary rock group, Rolling Stone wrote said: "Often no."
We meet in social measures and ballots.
However, I do not, I feel a bit cut off at the meetings.
I went from Apple during a difficult divorce.
I sent John Istanbul to the meetings and said: 'Remembrance me what everyone is saying because I cannot go to the table'.
It was too painful as if we could see our pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I only listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA Climate Model: Venera has once been an inhabitable planet
On the basis of the latest climate models of NASA, Venera has once been an inhabitable planet.
NASA Godarda's space research institute scientists have developed a model to explore Venera history, using tools and algorithms, as climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venera, whose surface has been hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere is made up almost exclusively of carbon, was once under the same conditions as the earth.
Scientists have said earlier that the slow speed of Venera driving is attributable to a dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venera has ever had a plan, a Earth's atmosphere and has slowly turned slowly.
The model also looks at the former topography of Venera.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity on the planet to enable life to develop and prevent water from being evaporated.
In the early days of Venice, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In simulation of GISS model, the Venera Greening model reveals that part of the daylight will last 2 months, GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process soils the surface of the planet and leads to a thing which, in turn, generates thick clouds acting as a umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the Solar.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than that on the Earth today.
The model portrays Venera's history, similar to the evolution theory developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once inhabitable, for several billion years Venera has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet races.
Its oceans were melting up and the shrimp was burned up by ultraviolet rays.
As water was completely hungry, only the carbon dioxide atmosphere of the plan, with fatal greenhouse gas - Venera, as we know today, remained over.
Scientists published the results of the new Venice climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patriarch Rose resigns from Avalanche's career as coach
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice-president of the Hockey Operations Patriarch, Patriarch, gave a comeback, citing the insufficient impact of the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's Vice President and Chief Executive Joe Say confirmed the message and said the club would start searching for new trainers immediately.
"For the last three years I have been vigorously, passionately and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice-president of the Colorado club's hockey operations," Roy, 50 years old said in a statement.
During this summer, I thought a lot about how I could improve team performance in order to give it the splendid nature it needs to achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the head manager and the vice-president of the hockey operation must be fully coincided with that of the organisation.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning team performance.
At the moment, these conditions have not been met.
The crowd that struck Rou on 23 May 2013 thanked Rous for his contribution to the team.
The message was that Patriarch informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him well for the future.
Roy was recognised as the best coach of the league in 2013-2014 and won the Jesca Adamsa Avalanche's first season.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Diplomatic, but the club has not been in the exhibition for two years.
Avalanche closed the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind Wild's team without a second special call by the Western Conference organisers.
Roy scored four points in his career, two with Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers are resuming negotiations and postponing the strike
Workers' strikes on the wages of workers in the North Sea oil platforms have been postponed, as both parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the negotiators said.
Periodic strikes are being organised against Wood Group, which operates Royal Dutch Shell, on North Sea oil platforms.
According to the joint statement, Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, with a view to revising the issues at stake.
Trade unions said their recent events, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were targeted at the planned reduction in salaries of 30 percent.
Under pressure from the Negative Market, Wood Group reduced the wages of workers in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of terrestrial workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional salary cuts would allow the company to experience a downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has already cut wages for several thousand people and announced plans to suspend oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparing for a large-scale merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week Scottish MEP David Andersson met workers' representatives to discuss the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the economy of the region.
In his report he explains that the North Sea and the state as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost USD 1.4 billion, compared to USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Keplify the speed of cutting of the voluminous stars into the feet of the Plesse.
The latest Kepkler Telescope mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of the take-off of stars in the feet.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars turn to different speeds in this stars, and how the speed of the stars converts to the creation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the stars' mass, age and even the history of its solar system," said World Caltech Infrastructure Process and Analytical Centre scientist Luisa Rebula.
The plebiscite is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this star are just starting to grow to around 125 million years of age.
They turn at maximum speed.
When counting at maximum speed, these growing stars emit a large amount of stars' wind.
When the stars come into the magnetic field, they are braking the stars.
As the stars grow older, their speed is decreasing.
Kever measure the speed of the return of each star, setting the time between the appearance of recognisable star areas such as the sunscreen.
The latest speed catalogue of stars shows that larger stars are slower than smaller stars.
The bubble compares the stars with the dampened, larger butchers perform the pirates more slowly than small butchers.
The Rebum tells us that the pledges must be on the white paper that the rotating sites are larger and larger, while the rotary sites are very small stars faster.
Thanks to the fact that the Pleme star is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory in which the characteristics of the stars can be compared to the speed of the race.
Rebull tells us that the Plessin star is helping to build theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of the stars is slowing down, and about the whole process of stopping them altogether.
The rebull and his colleagues gave a detailed analysis of the speeds of the Plessin stars in the three new publications which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journalism Prize.
