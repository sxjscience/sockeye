A 28-year-old doctor found dead in the San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old horizon, who has recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to go beyond his brother, saying: 'His life finally started to improve'.
A 28-year-old Frenchman, a 28 year old Frenchman, was identified as a 28-year-old Frenchman, a 28-year-old Frenchman, who was found in the Vestfhostage.
The French police said that his death was recognised as murder and is currently under investigation.
The Upura Brother Galicia said that the Frenchman had been working for a post in Boston in Boston, but six months ago he was in a restaurant restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in Sons & Daughters "Sanfrancisko.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that he was shocked and shocked.

"He came into a new apartment and met with a girl," Luiss told the radio station KGO.
Luiss Galicia claims that he does not know who would like to do over his younger brother.
He was a good man with a broad heart.

New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors demand their trade protests in the dispute over the new Treaty.
The UK Medical Association (LMA), the New Foreign Committee (JAK) intends to request a Council to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
The JAK considers that ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, the new doctors and medical students rejected the Treaty of LPA.
58% of all members voted in the vote.
In a report published on Wednesday evening, the JAK Council member Early Mccorn indicates that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract is rejected.
She said, 'In view of this, the JAK vote has led to the full rejection of the agreement and the decision to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues. "
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally called for a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS history.
After the vote rejecting the contract terms proposed by LMA, which was recommended by BMA, a new representative of the LMA new doctor, Dr. Johnawan.
Prior to the meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had said to BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Dgeremy Hants informed that the contract would be concluded with the median median of England.
Russia and Turkey: Resived alliance?
It is a shame that has ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to coin and announce eight months of the end of the war and the economic sanctions war.
However, Vladimir Putin has the impression that this partnership is more needed for Ankara, as the Turkish leaders in St Petersburg have the impression that these partnerships are more needed for Ankara.
However, both collapsed.
Vladimir Putin's hurt appeared and did not give rise to emotion, even taking into account his usual disticence.
On the other hand, the reintroduction of Tajikip Erdogan at least five times as a "dear friend," he said.
I felt the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to the pre-crisis levels but will become even stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan wins it as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm gives rise to contradictory feelings.
However, the radiation from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting of the Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara that it was inspired by the dunk in the back of Moscow.
The abuse was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
By restoring real confidence, it will perhaps even be impossible.
Since November, the Russian public position has changed.
For several months, the government controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly it was the Turks.
The most serious allegations were that the family of Erdogan's family has made profits from the illegal trade in oil with the Islamic State controlled by the Islamic State.
He has, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg Summit that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.
Russia could take this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of the Ankara Agreement are obvious.
Firstly, the Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month, in which he tried to overthrow.
The numerous terrorist attacks have also shaken their positions.
It is also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually provide a number of millions of Russian tourists every year in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, the Russian hauliers and the charter have also been made easier when regular flights are restored.
They hope to have a fever in the middle of the season in the Mediterranean.
This week, the national TV station provides for a lowering of fruit and vegetable prices, as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will be restored.
As the local newspaper has been quoted: 'Turists for them, tomatoes for us. "
However, there were other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West about, in their opinion, the weak response to the attempted coup.
It is also possible to address the frustration of the long-standing EU accession negotiations and the intervention of Putin, who is happy to use the situation that Turkey has alienated from the West.
The Russian leader won additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for the elected government after an attempted coup.
Take the fact that Moscow understands this well because it is deeply rooted in the fear of a change in the regime in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxury maritime Palace gave Russia and Turkey the possibility of presenting it as a analyst, 'marginalised alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, notwithstanding the unification of public demonstrations, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria where Russia presents itself as a media carrier, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the other side.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two Presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at the press conference.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided the issues of the disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member of the Russian Battlegroup has improved, the situation has improved because the two leaders have at least resumed the negotiations.
Scottish Royal Banka will no longer be available to consumers outside Scotland
The ICC will continue to play a role in the future, the Executive Director of the Bank said.
Extra Scottish SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Maevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the CBC brand was associated with the Bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions, because eight years ago, the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, Sbrands of the IASB have used the IRB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors from the Six Union and finally with Vimbldona Endie Mureju.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Wales, all references to the ICC will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
It will also be the smarter private financial brand, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
The charge was interviewed with customers and employees by InverlushIrish.
He said the BBC Scotland channel: "the CSKB will become the brand of our investors and which our workers are working with, because we are now more than a brand bank."
The Bank itself became a global brand and the IRB became a global brand.
I now say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their own sector and our workers will work with customers under these brands.
The ICC has already announced that the sponsorship of the Set Union and involve various brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"It is high time to become a brand bank because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?"
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we will become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not for our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
Once again, we can revive these brands again, so I think that now is the right time.
Frenkijs Detori has won 30000m, with the first place in Nizhny Predilection
The tori corroborated the championship with its 3000th victory in the first races in New Newcasales.
On Friday, the Frenchman Detori won its 3000th win in Britain's history, with the first place in Newcastle.
He achieved this by fighting the second victory in these races in his home city, with the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth fence that has reached the raison d'être of results in the races.
He has acceded to Seram Gordonam Ričardsam Dougam, Dougam Smitam, Lester Pigothen, Peter Edery and Villius Karson.
He said that "there is something specific.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this was the case in Newcastle, because I have been living here for 30 years.
These are not large races, this is not the Royal Askta, but a park on Friday evening with 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
After the victory over the Detori and the Predilection is expected with applause and light.
The two wins have reached this record: the champion of the champion of the champion of the champion of the champion of the champion of the champion Sir Antony, who has fled several records in his career.
Lesters Pigots, the winner was the winner in his career.
The Frenchman is one of today's best fences and it is not surprising that he has succeeded in achieving.
He is a strong and strong one, but his tactics distinguish her away from other fences.
He is a fantastic spokesman, his enthusiasm and the charisable years are attracting fans for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsomas, I said to the Frenchman that he had already won 6000 wins if only weekly weekend and large races.
However, it is a real pleasure, however, that the Frenchman has been in the hands of the United Kingdom for 30 years.
He is a life of life, which is perfectly useful in British races, and he is an excellent piece of fence.
The Frencher Detori noted this achievement with his firm mark - the flight noble.
Frenchman David Detori has been a British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a full way of life.
He has won a large number of large races, including the famous 1996 'Great Seven' in Askta, and the plane crash on the use of preparations.
Three years ago he was difficult to return after six months' disqualification, but he demonstrated his nature, challenging those who questioned him when returning to their best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time: tori has said in advance that it would be willing to continue to participate in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanovs, head of the administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dissolved the administration of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in Putting the nearest people for many years.
At the moment, the 63 year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative on natural and transport issues.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "has decided to exempt Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration," without mentioning the reason.
Antons Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012, was appointed.
The 44 years old Waino has been diploma.
The Gaino is born in 1972 in the Estonian capital in Tallinn, the prestige of the international relations institutes of Moscow (MVSAI) and subsequently worked in the Too embassy embassy.
As the Kremlin's homepage (Russian), later he led the Presidency's protocol and the management of the government staff.
After his appointment he said, "thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the State when drawing up laws and controlling the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his post as a substitute.
Is there a lot to convince?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a father and close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, the Soviet security service at the time worked in the Soviet security service.
He was one of the most powerful husbands in Russia.
In a public television session, the two men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But in spite of the smiled smiles, there is rarely such an explanation convincing, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official statement that the man who was regarded as a potential President suddenly wanted to become a head of Russian environmental policy, is perceived by a great deal of scepticism.
In the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says in the Kremlin's homepage: 'It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I would ask you to put this difficult office, could even say, problematic posts, four years.
It appears that I have worked for four years and eight months.
The Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He has previously been Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB National Security Service, as well as Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov took his post.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov to the five people who are most trusted.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was regarded as a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as the relegation of Putin to the third deadline would be anticonstitutional.
However, the President became another close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev became the President.
Putin became a prime minister and returned after three and a half years later.
In the classroom, the emergence of fish in a garden city of Bancoa
A man from Banfas is asking for help to clarify the circumstances of the species in his garden in Bananas.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could have been swayed with water.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres from the sea, released a fish video on the homepage of the fish, the hope that someone could know how these 5 centimetres are in his garden.
Church of wine: the bridge is now connected with Faife.
At the moment, the 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Kine fertiliser and viaduke, which means that the bridge is now connected with Faife.
The first of the four connected parts is complete, which means that the construction of the bridge is coming to an end.
The sealed-bridge structure is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support for cables.
Today, the 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic secretary Keits Brauns was today on the construction site and was one of the first to make a bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queen bridge."
In this project, we see an insurmountable engineering solution which only uses more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, the combination of bridges and waves is an extremely delicate process, which requires a huge amount of precision.
Overall, over 79% of the bridge has already been built and the last link to bridge the bridge with Rositu today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to stay.
Mr Martins Martins, Director of the fourth bridge, said: "The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the construction of higher class engineering.
After the installation of the last road section and its connection with the north of the north, we were forced to link the north of the road with the land part or the viaduke.
This was done by hanging the north of the north to the south of the villages in the north.
It was a huge and, at the same time, a very delicate operation.
Military, because viadukts are 222 metres long, weighs around 6000 tonnes and the drowning of around 3%.
It was only a few millimetres in the abundance of the team was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything succeeded.
Simona Bailsa obtained the gold exercise of gold for women.
The tension has been put on the table.
It is a matter of concern.
Simone Bailsu does not worry about this.
Dinamicably cheap.
Without effort, it is a piece of exercise that is not enough.
It is insurmountable to the floor.
It is perfectly perfect.
And finally the Olympic Championship.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gypsy champion fought the gold medals, demonstrating completely the difference between themselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
A total of 62,198 was a head of court over the winner of the silver medals of the silver medals of the silver medals of the silver medals of the Russian sports championship Alia Mustafinas.
On Thursday, US athletes Simona Bailsa carried out the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression.
Bailsa became the fourth American consecutive championship, which won the title of the Champions League title and the fifth best exercise, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best generator of his generation and perhaps the best exercise in the history of their generation.
When the final result was announced, she came into sharp, because the long road to this was the end of the day.
It is a success for them next to unparalleled athletes like Maikl Felps, who raised their form of sport at another level.
For the last three years, Bailsa has prevailed in its sport for the last three years, including 10 gold medals in the last three medals, including 10 gold medals in the last three years.
In Brazil, she was expected to be the last test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the expectations that were placed on him and not with the other athletes.
She is a disappointment if she returned to her home in Springa, Texas without gold medals.
Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane surrounded by the gold and silver medals in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medals won the first gold medals on Tuesday, making the Marta Karolji Warolji.
While Bailsa claims that in their long way to the wet surfaces were not expected, it is not true.
A part of her predecessor in free movement, which includes her special acrobotic transition, conducts a Latin musium musician, who would be wonderful in the street next to the Rio Olympics.
It is not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and which was revealed by a third home in the Eimia Burmy home in the excursion on sports, where the Burmanes of the Burmanes of the Burmane, has become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost a series of races since the summer of 2013 and the series of win has continued as long as Bailos wants it for a long time.
Even though Mustafina was somewhat under the leadership of the Mustafina, it was only a illusion.
The weights and free movement - the part of the competition, where Bailos will defend his title, is still before us.
She was at the forefront of 15,433 to the beam and strengthened leadership with the result of 15.933 in free movement
Raismane skeled her, while she expected the results that were only formality and his expedient in sharp tears when she came to the dream she had ever recorded in her book book.
The result of the Raisman was a small reprisal of four years of events in which she shared the third place with Mustafins, but lost the fight for the bronze medals.
The 22-year-old team, which the Americans are calling "grandmothers," led to a convincing leadership.
After this, she was able to dedicate the air smoke into the free movement, which dispelled the doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate the air smoke.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bailsas headlines, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
The 6 year old Mahajs Brauns "cold in Filadelphia.
Police said that the 66-year-old bird was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that this is the second 60 year of Filadelphia.
Children's parents CBS Filadelphia confirmed that it was Mahai Brauns.
Older parents say that Brauns was shot several times, including in the circus, in the feet, in the arm and in the cool, but there was still to be conscious when he was carried on to hospital.
His grandmother of Deloresa Melendeza tells television: 'His small body was simply a bullet cold. "
I am unable to believe that.
He has been placed in a critical state in a critical state and several operations have already been subjected.
The family shall be informed that he will certainly recover.
He had to start the first clash at the local primary school.
Driving is one of the four people shot in the town of Jermantag.
Three men were also shot: two men for 29 years and one 32 years old was shot dead.
The Canal CBS Filadelphia reports that one of the 29 years old is in a critical condition, while the situation of the other two victims is stable.
The Canal said that the child was found in the predominant seat of the car, along with the 29 year-old victim, in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the machine and the police investigate whether any of them were attacked.
CBS Filadelphia said the Canadian channel CBS Filadelphia that several shooters were most likely to be shooting.
In the place of provenance, the guns of the guns belonging to different weapons.
It appears that it has been a long shot.
A shell was found on both sides of the pedestrians.
"As a result, there have been several armed shooters here who played an active part in firing," the Filadelphia police captain Antonijs Ginaldi.
A number of mothers and cars have also been done.
No one has yet been detained and it is reported that the police check the records of the observation cameras.
During the shooting of a 6-year-old girl in her apartment in Vestoukleina in her apartment in the Vestoukleina district.
She is slowly recovering, but police are still looking for the perpetrator.
Why do we need Simona, Gabon and Lauria?
I refer it to the annual Women's Olympic Vieglatltu Komandu for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been to all the summer Olympics since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three easy Latvians, Simona Bailsa, Gabon Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, which inspires many girls of new origin.
People can be proud that the teams also contain Alija Raismane, which is a Jewish and Medisona Kociana, which is a Catholic section.
Finally, this team is truly representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of Black and Latin American sportspeople in this sport.
For the last four years, the best exercise is the Americans' American origin.
Last year, the Symphony and the Gabon took place on 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games Gaby Duglash became the Olympic champion and the Americans were able to celebrate.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises carried out by the triple world championship Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, with unprecedented but mestery exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth Americans in a row that has won the gold medals in the individual struggle for women.
He won the silver medal.
We have seen the best thing that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country, the situation is completely different in the rest of the country.
Simona, Gabon and Lauria entered the Olympic read as Alija and Medison.
They are the 'Olympic Five', as the next Olympic exercise team will be just four sportsmen and this is the latest third year of the third Olympic exercise.
In fact, exercise is expensive sport: the gypions are mostly trained in private LVT clubs and are kept by parents paying for coaches, premises, travel, formasks, hotels, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenditure.
Most of these small Latin club club is located in urban areas which can afford this sport.
These clubs spend all their coaches, and this is a costly and long contribution to the LVL.
Eimija Burmy, Simona Bailsas and Megija Hainija, Laurie Hernandezas, has coached their athletes since both girls started to operate with a light.
We must ensure that young girls inspire Simona, Gabon and Lauria, cheaper exercise exercises.
I set my light Latin American organisation 20 years ago.
It is my organization in Harlew and we offer over 15 000 urban young people (mostly black and Spanish) exercises, free of charge or at a low price; we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open the branch in Detroit (my home city) to enable local young people to get to know this excellent sports.
Vieglatltika develops the coordination of forces, channels and bodies, as well as teach hard work, disciplines and targets.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in light and it is fantastic.
It is very important to work with this type of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
I thank Simona, Alija, Gabon and Medison for the excellent 'Meel Force', with the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of the proposal by Georgetown Hanta, the new doctors plan to extend more strikes.
Ministers had hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on the changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association, which was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, the Hants announced plans to conclude a contract stating that the NHS is in a precarious situation and further delay will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which makes changes to the conditions for night change and weekend to improve working conditions in non-standard hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr Echeapna Makourta, a new doctor in BMA announced that the new doctors are still a serious concern about the proposed Treaty, especially that this will aggravate the labour crisis and does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
It is eight weeks away until the first new foreign group is to sign the new treaty, so there is a lot to make progress, because the time is not long enough.
Efforts by BMA to resolve the problem through the negotiation of a problem with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened despite the fact that, even last month, James Hants said that his doors were always open.
A gesture to Hansen must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
At the last strike, over 13,000 ral operations were suspended at the end of April and 100 000 visits were suspended while nurses and advisers tried to replace the treatment that had gone in the picket.
Ministers had hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on the changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work for the weekend of 54 000 new doctors to which the new treaties would apply.
The NHS's Executive Director, Daniels Mortimers, called for the new doctors not to go into strikes.
Mr Mortimera explains that the strike does not resolve anything, but only increases the pressure on busy workers and worries, is causing stress and hindrances for patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have spoken with the new doctor committee and with the Ministry of Health and the other institutions have responded positively to their questions on borrowers and rapporteurs.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues such as the deployment of staff, flexible training, further training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, mutual recognition of training programmes, mutual recognition of training programmes, study abandonment and gender pay inequalities in medicine - show that employers, the UK health education institutions and the Ministry of Health seriously want to reach agreement concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products may reduce the risk of heart attack on the day.
Thousands of patients, who have had a heart of heart, could be treated with medicinal products on 2 Munds a day, as the official representatives rerecommend them to use more people and a longer period.
Ticagrelor, Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated hearts for people with heart limits.
These medicines are already prescribed for use 12 months after heart, reducing the risk of repeated hearts.
NHS represents a comment on the use of this preparation for 4 years after heart, to further reduce the risk of heart and vascular problems for people with cardiovascular problems.
At present, however, NICE is currently under the responsibility of NICE to use this preparation for 4 years after heart, with a view to further reducing the risk of cardiovascular risks.
Each year, around 140 000 people in England are witnessing a heart and a quarter of them are witnessing a restroke or a stroke.
The heart of the cardiovascular and insult causes the accumulation of fatty substances in the heart of the constitution.
If the dam is plunged, it could create thrombs by blocking the flow of blood to heart and causing heart stripping.
However, if thrombs are released from blood-borne walls, it could go further in the bloodbath and to block blood access to the brain, causing infarts.
People who have been in the heart of our heart are at greater risk of repeated hearts.
Ticagrelor manufactured by British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombin.
The new NICE Guidelines, released today, recommend that people use 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and a further 3 years by 60 mg twice a day with aspirace.
Professor Kerola Longsona, Director of NICE, explains: 'Despite the availability of medicines for the prevention of repeated hearts, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart, is going through another heart or stroke, which often have serious consequences. "
Fear of repeated hearts may have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor combined with aspirace effectively reduce the risk of repeated hearts and attacks on people who have experienced it once.
In provisional terms, with Ticagrelor, we are delighted that we can extend the possibilities of treatment for thousands of people who are thus winners.
Taking into account the limited information on Ticagrelor's efficiency and safety, especially the risks of bloody assimilation for more than three years, the draft guidelines will not recommend that it be used for longer than this deadline.
Politkovskaya contributes to electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurs Rahman, former mayor of the town, Lutfurs Rahman was dismissed for corruption.
The report by the government reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
The former government minister, Sir Eriks Pikls criticise police, election supervisors and urban councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "I fear the ethnic and religious interests'.
The former secretary of communities, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards on election stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should show the identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters have only to indicate the word and address.
He is even recommending the purchase of a vote by voters with a special tink to avoid a double vote.
Sers must also provide more protection, says Sir Eriks.
He considers that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud but also protect local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud which go hand in hand with it. "
The report was ordered by Dauningstrite following the scandal in the case of the local elections of the Economic and Social Committee.
Last year a special electoral court ruled the city of Lutfuru Rahman from the city mayor of the city as a result of the corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found Rahman's cynical missivity of his Muslim community and silenced its critics, accused of racist and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign to make the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him."
Around 300 votes were falsified or doubtful, as one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks said that there are indications of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that fraud in the vote by post, where the senior members of the Muslim communities had forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric said a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the identification of a person's identity, in order to establish the identity of the person.
His report says "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the oldest selected candidates of communities, especially in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities."
"There is a fear that the authorities are not focusing on these problems because of political correctness, as the interests of ethnic and religious interests could be affected."
Sers set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to operate through votes cast by post in order to prevent the "bulk" votes.
The report, which is examined by Ternea Meja, also calls for a more thorough registration of registration to prevent the use of voter lists in the area of immigration and benefits.
To consider the possibility of requesting voters to present a identity document before the vote.
To mark the purchase of a vote by voters with special ink to avoid double voting.
The systematic examination of the nationality of persons in order to ensure that the person is entitled to vote.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by post.
To prevent political campaigners and activists from the ballot box and the ballot box.
Ensure the police to consult the polls at the polling stations.
Changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons responsible for intimidating the acts under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
To prevent photographic polling in the polls.
To bring the requirement to use only English in the polling stations (except Wales).
Increase training to ensure that voters go to the ballot box per one.
Sir Eric sharply criticises the Metropolitan police without questioning the fact that no accusation has been made in the case of the Tauerhamleta case.
He tells him that "the Electoral Court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative on corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly found guilty of the criminal law evidence standard, based on unthrow evidence.
He also criticizes the inefficient urban domination of voters in the polls.
Sir Eric said: "The Court's decision last year is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the homeland of the parliament, but the worrying and hidden spread of the electoral fraud and the pretension of the institutions that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.

In the middle of an inclusive shop, she took them out of a thriving subsistence, disillusioned their strains and the bicks and even on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where they were measuring, she simply went on to the room.
Everyone watched she was disillusioned and obviously a woman did not like them because she was simply thrown back on the shelf.
She featured three more bicks up until she decided that she did not like and abandoned the shop.
It did not seem to worry that anyone looks at or think about the people who would buy the clothes that she has had.

How to protect themselves from firearms by means of Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it somewhat safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in a distance from the firearm, we agreed with Krav Maga's giant from New York Rona Mizraki.
Whether you are attacking the front or the back, this video shows how to protect themselves and win over the attackers.
The wounds shall indicate where the attacker is attacked by the back of the back, the first thing is to go to see the attacked and avoid shot trajectories.
The weapon must then be struck between its own forehand and the shoulder and make the enemy in the face with their free elite.
Then there follows the lake through the circus and while the invasion of the sun has to take his weapon in the face of the circus and continue to take the weapon against her.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar: one must avoid shot trajectories, the weapon must be shot and cherished in such a way that the evil cannot be fired.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and put the opponent on the preponderance and finally take away his weapon on her.
It is complicated to listen?
You have a video to see how Mizraki is doing this.
However, you will remember if you do not have Krav Maga's master, it is safer to return my money to the robbery.
The Gandal family has demolished Saltah Kornvolas social house and is being put on the streets.
The Gandal family has been put out of residence for neighbouring terrorist attacks, causing damage to the social house of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, met from Saltata Kornvolus, as several complaints were submitted to them.
When they were forced into the property, the shock of the Hosted Housing Service found that the property was completely demolished.
In the morning and walls there was a racist pass everywhere, the waste and the wall had a graphic wall everywhere.
The family is now wasted and is most likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, the head of the Cornvolas Housing, says that there is a concern that housing will not be possible.
She tells us that people living here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live.
In this case, there are a number of factors to be assessed, because in future, this property in Cornwall will not be of good repute.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons, which have been held periodically and by the police, that their terror had been divulged as violence, external delinquency, the intimidation of the local population, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs, the sale of drugs and the looming and laxing.
The 47 year old Scandinadei, which has been a property, was fined for antisocial behaviour in June.
The most demolished houses were found on the rooms of the wall.
In the home where drugs are previously traded, several of the floor boards are also exciting.
The Neighbours say that they have regularly been on the street and are constantly being called police.
The Cornvolas Housing Service put them out of the property forcibly when they had 11 weeks to collect them voluntarily.
The missed neighbours were very happy about eviction, because their lives were absolutely helpless.
One said: 'They were not concerned by other citizens'.
We lived in them for 20 years, it has always been a trees.
It is incredible how often we have seen the police.
We were unable to sleep this morning.
We wake up because there was so silence here - we are not accustomed to it!
Now that they are at last away, there will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatik, who is the head of the neighbourhood of the Cornvolas Housing Service said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and has been regularly called police.
There were different old and unspent objects.
He also said: 'It is a great pity that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because the eviction is always the last step to congratulate the Cornvolas Housing Service. "
It was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and the neighbours had been very serious in their behaviour.
I appreciate the work done in this case by my entire team, the Devon and Cornvolas police and members of the compartment who were brave and collaborated with us, providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for its neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatriks said that all three sons have lived here in different periods, but everybody was about 20 years old.
A pure hair left on the floor of one of the room after the pretence.
The services of the service will now have to meet the growing waste of waste left in the home.
In 2014, the police carried out a search and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, important, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
The classic is only found guilty in the storage of class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for the monument to her son Lower Veeldonam, who died in the accident in 2013.
After pretending, it has become known that they are renting a private property in Plimits.
Many homes had been marked on many homes.
Police said they will continue to put the Irish people in breach of their rental agreements.
The Dayton and Cornvolas police spokeswoman Andijan indicate that this eviction is a clear warning to the other Irish people who continue to breach the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as wants and have no consequences'.
The Dayton and Kronvolas police do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The readiness to spend can give momentum to the economy.

The President, who remained in the building: Gustavam Zemgalam, 145
On Friday 12 August, the second Latvian president of Latvia, Gustav Zemgale, the second Latvian president of Latvia.
The Latvian State was proclaimed to have been the most widely described first Latvian President of Latvia, the final president of Latvia, the final president of Latvia, and the final president of the first round of the first round of the Latvian Presidency.
None of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgale, the Maleke Zemgale write Arnolds Auzins.
In the Delfi portal, Auzins stresses that the Zemgale is one of the few high-posts politicians who have had a sense of humour.
The rest is always very correct.
He teaches this far, today it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vejonis today.
"He was a close to the people," said Auzins.
Today's politicians are badly aware of history, they referred to Karl Ular Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely knows how unhappy he was.
The only person to whom he was not a blatant was General Balodis.
Even if in his bills he is kindly and smile, he was hysterical.
"The end of our humour and democracy leaves exactly the opposite impression," Auzins said.
Professor Aivars Stranga, Latvian University of History and philosophy of the Latvian University, Aivars Stranga, agrees with Auzina's assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and balanced statesman.
He also notes that the Zemgale has grown with respect for minorities, has regularly called on the Jewish representatives to the presidential Palace.
"At that time it was not usual, after the final Presidency, Albert Kviesis, the historian said.
He was a silent and weighty man who had had to speak for a President for a long time.
He did not aspire after it was simply not a trap.
He also looked quite critically, because he did not know the French, but believed that the President should certainly understand it.
"At the time of the Presidency, French language bases were taught," Strang said.
Zemgale did not allow for a renegotiation, he did not really have the same job.
In all respects, he was a very dignified person in Latvia's history, even before he became President, was in a serious position - he was a very demanding notation.
Zemgale led the famous Low Suvorova Street in 3, where the rebel and the rebel member came in practical government negotiations by the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
It was not a great fan of Ulmage, but he also did not hold him.
"In private negotiations, it has sometimes been said that he does not sympathise with him," Stranga said.
A peaceful life was living, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How does the Earth remember today?
It is a pity, but a large part of he is associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, the view was central.
"At his time there was no great turbulence at his time, namely he could be associated with a genuine Presidency," the Strang Stranga.

Simply ways of helping the child to cope with anger slowly.
I am often faced with the fact that the parents of the child, the appearance of a child is regarded as wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows its anger: we do not know how to react, "Econet says" I'm not aware of how to react, "Econet said.
The Special Representative urges a small amount of negotiations on these natural and human feelings - anger and the rage that every one is going through.
The grey - it is already a physical activity directed against another people and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we, adults, are anxious, alarmed - usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can say, suppress, hate, keep in touch, tell our friends or other relatives, we can say to our friends or other relatives, we can say to our friends or other relatives, we can say a strange, to praise the cigarette (this is not the best way to disperse anger!), walk with the head and other things normally do not.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children are not aware of what happens to them, as they are called and how they are to live.
They can say: 'Oh away,' I'll be the silly, "" Slikta mamma, "" I'm not going to be you, "" I'm not going to be you, "" I'm not going to go through you ',' I'm not going to see you.
Children are living literally, they are entirely here, at this point, they are spontaneously and truly manifested in the footsteps of their feelings, and often have different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not ban feelings of feelings, including anger, not to be ashamed of it and not, on the contrary, to help the child.
Do you have to do so?
A long working day, where everything quite does not go as I would like to see, or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to see a moment, a day, or even longer 'to' off 'from around the world.
Is it possible to see relations and to breathe a little into a moment?
Or does it, however, show that each of the partners has its way to go?
In my opinion, the gentlemen is divided in different ages.
Jānis (23) is short and succinct: 'In my view, if the relationship requires a pair, it is not with the right people. "
In the meantime, Eduards (30) has revealed a scheme that could help someone to help.
If you feel that a partner is beginning to fall to the nerves for every small detail, then surely it is the right moment to explore other hunting fields to understand whether you are missing or not, or in particular their lack of willingness to see them.
So the answer is yes, the holding of a pair can help save time and understand how important you have the other half.
Kaspars (29) reveal their theory.
In my opinion, the relationship has to be paved to each other on a daily basis, because if you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the dispute is inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I am doing every detail that the other does, and it is beginning to fall to the nerves.
People are beginning to take each other, especially if there is no more talk about what you have done on the day.
My personal experience makes it think, so I have not had a relationship for a couple of months too.
If you think at some point that somehow else or else is better - why the woman with whom you are together deserves someone who can think about the fact that there is not enough good and behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a small toll.
If not, there is no.
"I have a somewhat fine sentence on those who do not."
The Carriers (33) have a completely counterproductive opinion.
I think all of us need a moment for breathing.
You could not have every moment, all the time, from morning to night, to watch one another eye and curve about the unfortunate love.
Attolid!
There are so many things: friends, work, balleries.
Everything has its own time.
Of course, the friendship or the wife of course, but if both are to be able to balance them between family life and the rest of the world, it can live up to the captain.
It is only that and only it.
Mārtiņš (27) tells us: 'It is hard to say - must or should not be taken into account, but one thing is clear: it is clear that it does not have anything to do with something. "
If this issue is raised, it must be assumed that there will be some change in the near future - to the good or the bad side, it will depend on themselves.
I think that, while there is a new and truck, it is always necessary, but when everything remains seriously and relations are entering a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about the rest.
You are, however, deciding to spend all life together!
"If you are not able to withstand each other, and once again you need breathing, then what will be when you are going to be pensioners who commend on how the meteoric cats or the dispute over which the day is to be better worry," the Kristaps (19).
All Mr words have been changed.
With its enthusiastic and enthusiastic personalities, Rozental has first wakened interest in the Latin American countrymen.

German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the communist yoke could be much higher than previously believed, but doubts about the actual number of victims remain undispersed.
According to the data on Wednesday, the Berlin Wall wall of the Berlin Wall Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with Western allies areas and the subsequent Western wall Communist authorities in West Germany, who tried to escape their territory.
The museum of border deaths has been studied for years and every day the number of victims is corrected.
A further 11 deaths have been added to the list, including the victims of a six-year old boy who drowned, trying to get West through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also the deserts of the Soviet army.
"The ultimate level of damage caused by the doubling of Communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," said Alexander Lill, a museum of museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of persons who died in an attempt to escape from the Communist state," said Hillary Hillary said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The ville 1841 is unconvincing," the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung said in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, together with the other researchers of the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and only 260 cases have so far been able to approve.
In the past, researchers said that only 138 people have murdered 138 people.
In the light of those people who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or become Western through the neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However, this is far less than 1841.
One of the different causes of the number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Muzeei also lists all cases of suicide in the East Germany border guard, whether they were directly linked to their services.
The museum also lists deaths which are not linked to direct violence.
"If the old age of 70 to 80 years after a break with border controls died of the consequences of this" murderous border, "the Hillary said.
However, this is the reason why a distinction must be made between the old people who probably died as a result of the circumvention and those who have been killed in a long waiting time at the border.
Regardless of its victims' inventory is not easy, since the Communist authorities of Eastern Germany did not accumulate such statistics, and researchers should choose the documents in the different archives of the archaic archives.
However, the group has recently spared new documents and could therefore, in the near future, come up with a new estimate of the number of victims.

Pone, who is a member of the Executive Committee of the LOK, has sharply criticised the activities of the LOK, leading to the supervising of the Olympic Games.

He also criticised Jakubovski, saying that before the London Olympic Games were not confirmed among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Federation (FINA) and called for Latvia not to send any sports.

Between the first and the last storm, the Helena Glover and Heteres Staningas was of particular importance for Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though the boat has only two sportsmen, they spent the Marina Williams who inspired them up to the second Olympic golden medals in the airing of the two Olympic gold medals in the airing of couples in the history of British sport, which has made such progress.
They were unquestionably dominated because they were not able to be unparalleled, an unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with a bed in the water surface does not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind the gold medals of gold medals is a whole team working hard to improve the performance of their performances and the greatest contribution to their success has led to a coach who did not know if they were not aware of this day, because he was diagnosed with the cancers.
According to him, this disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had the thrust of the urine, which is one of those that can and has been operational.
If it did not do this, it would spread over the whole body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
This slightly changes the vision of your fares.
Falsified cancer revealed in December 2013.
It was a trio that William can start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 season and to reduce the length of the break to the minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated the recovery.
I was in hospital and I went to 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, although the doctor said that a few steps were enough.
All of this started.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first idea was immediately about Viljama, who was very worried about the morning and talked more than usual.
The Standing, which has served in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional week, but this means a great deal '.
This only confirms how much it means and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years behind Helena and Robin have been excellent.
Without Roblin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better coach member or better coach.
Helena Glovere and Hetere Staninga has not lost any races.
The rest reaches the enormous speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to move, Standing and Glover AGlover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helmut Kohl: "Maintenance rolling stock" keeps rolling stock. "
The loss of concentration is really important.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we did not have the intention to overthrow the record, but simply to row and win the races and we did it.
The rest of the year will rest to decide what to do further.
For the next month, there will be Glover Glover and television adventure, Stala Bashala.
For the moment, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that these were my last competitions.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, I had some six months to understand that I am the Olympic Championship.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it needed around four minutes.
She said: "I'm fantastic."
A unique opportunity to look at Los Angeles's fantastic architectural architecture.

Koleggova, head of the Revenue Service, will take the lead to the latest. "
According to him, Prime Minister Marim Kucinskis (Greens / Farmers) and Finance Minister Daniel Reizniece-Ozlai (Greens / Farmers) is already "essential for the Revenue Service's role as a candidate for the Revenue Service.
Rajevskis cheap that both Kuchinskim and Reizniece-Ozso in this government, the approval of the head of the SRS is a "first big decision," which could affect their future as a politician.
If the position of the candidate for the post of head of the Revenue Service is now to be changed, it will have a negative impact on their imidse public administration.
The Cabinet of Ministers is on the agenda for next week's sitting on the agenda for the next week's meeting of the Revenue Service, according to the government's agenda.
For the Revenue Service's head of Revenue, Reizniece-Ozola as head of the Revenue Service, and when the Revenue Service's head resigned in Inara Petersone and when the Revenue Service's head had been completed without the result.
Dace Peleka, the head of the Revenue Service's office, Dace Pelethical, on Thursday 11 August, the Latvian Radio allowed her to stand as head, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance said at a later stage that other candidates for the post of head of the Revenue Service were not yet dealt with.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the National Alliance, Saeima, said that the NDP is still in favour of Kolegolov, under the auspices of the Revenue Service.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the failure to set up a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) presented its opinion that Spain and Portugal have not taken sufficient measures to reduce the deficit levels required by the euro area by 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
The estimates indicate that, despite the austerity measures taken, the Portuguese budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year, and in Spain 5. 1% in Spain.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while establishing fiscal targets for the coming time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against the two countries, is the growing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions for such a negative mood would only increase.
Critics indicate that the EC's decisions are not consistent in its decisions, by agreeing on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, Jenss Veidmane, the President of the Bundesbank, Jenss Veidmane pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself, giving citizens the impression that European Union rules are a matter of recommendations and not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all the Member States have approved the extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit before the end of this year to Portugal and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission is promising to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances are required.
The initial forecasts suggest that the target set for Portugal could be achieved in the course of the deadline and the budget deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that in the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement the austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be integrated into this year's budget, with additional attention being paid to the cost of the purchase of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit needs to be reduced to 4. 6%, next year to 3. 1% and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, in the next two years, consolidation measures must be 0. 5% of GDP every year.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, public opinion polls suggest that the third elections in the country would not change substantially in the country.
The Populary Party is still a party of the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, who would once again win the elections.
The popularity of our citizens has been a little more than the socialists, while the Podemos party, or 'Together we can' and Ciudadanos', or 'Citizens' popularity has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants the socialist and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government even this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit to the European Commission the draft 2017 budget for approval.
As the spokesperson for the People's Party, Rafaels Hernando, if the government is to establish a non-government and parliamentary elections will, however, be organised for the third time, Spain will become a pan-European laughing.
The purity of Irons in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
For the fifth year, the activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found is growing every year, and most of all the visitors to the sites.
The most polluted bathing areas are the most polluted sites.
The Capital Award explains that bathing sites are coping every day, but it is very difficult to fight the dirty visitors.
In addition, waste in the land may be washed in water during rainfall, thereby causing a considerable loss of quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and some places in Kurzeme, the pudge in other places in Latvia is critical.
This announcement has been made this week by the volunteers of "My Sea."
For the fifth year on the road along the Gulf of Riga, activists have concluded that the number of waste left to the population has increased every hundred metres.
This year, unfortunately, this is a critical assessment of the critical nature this year.
"We can see that this will be a year when the number of waste per beach 100 metres may even go beyond 200 units," said Vejonis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio has been called back, he came to the immediate beach where a voluntary move along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, the various municipal waste and the pictures of the pivotal waves, even the fluorescent lamps left in the sands of the sea.
A participant and organiser Ulme teic is to blame the people.
"The main source is the plastic visitor themselves, since more than half of total waste is plastic, different waste, from purse, plastic parcels that are already at the stage of the degradation, they are no longer able to be identified and smoke, bottles, corps," Ulme Ulme.
There are also sites in Riga between the most unclean beaches.
For example, in Daugavdegree, nearly 800 waste units have been gathered on average, with a critical mass.
The organisers of the campaign also make clear that you are also smoking and not all the signs or signs of a ban everywhere.
"Average figures for all three Riga bathing areas together - Daugavgrliabilities, Yearbul and Parents - are unfortunately higher and far beyond the desired or objective that Latvia is advancing to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender concludes.
The cleaning of the sites in Riga took place every day, in the summer hotter days, explains a spokesman for the City of Riga.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who use alcohol, smoking and do all things that may not, even in particular, do not work," said Medium skis.
For this reason, it calls on the EU to report the polluters to the police as well.
The police may be called to indicate those infringements safely and in such a way as to combat all of them.
Perhaps some new warnings may be imposed but, as I said, it will hardly change the situation.
"Since everybody together simply has to go and be intolerant to such violations," he said.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer, which could impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as well as other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that water quality in all 56 bathing sites has been good and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"For the last time, we will take the analysis at the end of August," said Normunds Kadixis.
Think waste may be washed in water during the torrential rainfall.
This may in turn affect its quality, the Environment Officer shall be indicated.
Rotation of the Rotation of Rotation continues to change the head of Putina's administration.
He has left the post?
Vladimir Putin, the Russian media, said that Sergei Ivanov has ordered his post and will continue to be the President's Special Representative for Nature, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin devoted Ivanovs to the television cameras: 'The hall of Sergej Borisovič, we are working together with you for many years and we are working together for many years. "
I am satisfied with how you fulfil your responsibilities.
I remember well about our agreement not to make use of you as President of this President for more than four years.
That is why I am aware of your willingness to change the scope of the action.
And I hope that in your new role, you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the administration of the President is a very important job and it made Ivanov as one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that Russia is expected to hold a State Duma elections next month, it is rumours that this step relates to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
The Ivanov was also called a potential deputy for Putin as a possible substitute for Putin, which is why he himself wanted to take the office of President of the President on Nature and Transport, has raised doubts.
According to Lit.lv Archives, Ivanov is a master of the GB and the Federal Security Service.
The Ivanov has been a long-standing and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began in 1970 in his own light services, which took place in 1965, where he was familiar with Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was designated as a secretary of the Security Council of Russia.
In 2000, following the Putina's coming to power, a Ivanova "Information Security Doctrine", which included in Russia the revival of public censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became a Russian Defence Minister, but in 2005 the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President of the President's administration, Vaino will also work.
The picture comes from the family council in the elite.
The head of the Presidency's administration, Vaino said himself.
We are familiar with Antonu Eduardovic for a long time.
Even from the time when we worked under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we have been in contact practically every day.
"I am therefore confident that, after all professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The picture comes from a family belonging to the council's elite.
His grandfather Karle took high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years to 1988 was its first secretary.
The internet's "Meduza" with a reference to the book "The self-determination and independence of Estonia" writes that, at the end of the 80th year, Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he had received a refusal and has lost his seat shortly.
Shortly after that, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has made a pledge to the Moscow International Institutes and administers Japanese language.
However, he has gone from a diplomatic service to work in the management of the presidential protocol.
It has already been said that Russia has been shaken by a number of senior officials and even arrests, including the replacement of the governor and federal representatives of several areas.
As the polytologists indicate, President Vladimir Putin replaces the ruling elite before the forthcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that there are representatives of the structures of force.
The Judo Bugiforenko is also losing the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the battle, and the Latvian jet fought for its participation in the Olympic Games in the first place.
Treneris Oleg Basket Basketza said that there were very few hopes in Niziforenko, and it has already been clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the Judo fought in the fight was a flat trauma.
It is remarkable that, if the Olympic Trumark, Newikiforenko had to be raced in another weight category than the prevalence - namely by weight to 100 kilograms.
The Armenian fighting was 25 kilos heavier.
As reported, Jevgenijs Borodavko in the fight against Raroosuki in the fight against Raroosuki for two and a half minutes.
As a result, Latvia has a teeth race in Rio.
The cities will disappear in Rio sands.
The fourth day was opened by Jevgenijs Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more tight opponent, but ambitious times are sometimes able to surprise.
He did not supply.
The challenge for Artous Newcaiforenia was even more complicated because of the lower and enemy of the smaller and enemy.
A similar, even though he held a one-and-a-half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, there is a lack of ambition among the Latvian gentlemen.
Guns Kirsons and his financial corner Vladimir Vejonis has gone away from Latvia and his financial corner, Greater Greater Vejonis, the Golden Score is no longer the 'Galden Score' - the development of the club.
Jackeus who is consulting the Kazakh jet and Vsevoldam Zoony does not see my heirs.
But if we do not grow, there will also be no.
And it is a prerogative of federation.
For this reason, as part of other gallery Rita panorama, the President of the Latvian Federation of Djibo, the Rio de Janeiro Federation.
The flight is far from reality.
Yesterday, with eagerly and concerns, we expected the beaches of the beach, Samoilovs / Schmeddins - Evane / Pecane
Intriga as a "death" group: the losers have ended.
Latvia's durability was a small derogation, but not more than four points in two two contexts.
The tension was still a long last game.
Nobody wished to die - this enthusiastic sense over the windy corner.
The forces of the game created additional complications for the players.
It started at the beginning that this could be ours - which is more comprehensive - an ally.
But it was not.
The Latvian duta was quite easy to play here.
It is so to Samoilova and wait when he is going to crack.
Canada plated against Cuba at the end of the first season and at the end of the third first, because the load was not the joke.
The moderate was able to make a mackerel at the time, because the work was not enough, but when it was done it was fair.
Driving Samoilovs could win two seasons, as the first seized management took over the top 16: 15, but 16 were also left behind, with a limit of 16: 15.
But it could also be lost by 0: 2, as the second shortfall was -4, but it was also thanks to the wind.
The third has already gone to the Evanian Conservatives.
Veidotic chain: the unconvincingly taking on the reserve, the second match often goes far too close to the network and the Samoilovam remained at a very low level of result-oriented attack.
If there were any foreign Samoilovs in the square fields, then this time he was more successful, and only to pay the loss would not be unprofessional.
The Kremlin was also wrong, and it was symbolic that the last bloc blockade was hit.
The team is in the spotlight.
There was certainly a lack of success this time: the third alone, two Evane attacks were almost flying out of the cort, but the ball was still affected by the line.
The two ears were along the line.
The most contentious epizodes in favour of opponents.
If, in the first two games, it was very productive for our own people.
Everything together summed into the taboo.
The causes of the failure must now be analysed peacefully.
Perhaps a lot should have been living next to the stadium and not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It is a good thing for two and a half hours
Maybe a little self-confident in a seven-half-finalist series.
Perhaps Klagenfurans did not have to play but to come here more quickly and better acclimatisation.
Perhaps there was a mistake with finding a surface of the athletes.
For the moment, there are more questions than answers.
Our bishers have finished the game.
The wave of medals expired.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup and the Jurmala Masters have also been postponed.
This moderate with Samoilova has never been a friend and no one, because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, there is also the idea of a divorce, because the blame will not only be found in the fault, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to divorce, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a dignified partner.
For both brothers play a bishop, but Janis with Toms have already tried and also self-restraint, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start the world's top.
It is possible to try to return to the Malalian Registry, Alexander Soloveju, to return to the Maltese Padow, but it will not be better than this option, which has proved to be no better than the one that demonstrated themselves at the stages of the World Cup.
The coin has smiled to them this time.
And everything.
Of course, account must also be taken of the fact that the beach volleyball is becoming more popular, it is more than two metres and only the real growth is less than two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Nowadays there is no longer.
Both sportsmen and journalists have the opportunity to wear in the places offered by the organisers and to choose their own.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, a part of the tennis will not remain in the Olympic village.
Likewise, a part of the beach voyyyum has also found a hotel in Copact.
This time, the very modest nights were required for journalists to have high exaggerated prices.
That is why the choice fell to apartment.
The risk is, because sometimes they may be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
At this time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimir, the Irish apartment apparatus on the Copact and Ipanema.
Plaim 200 metres away, the bishop of the bishop of the mess.
Rajon is safe because the favelas pathode, but it is not here too.
Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir, who is not immediately imagined, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media, Vladimir Ivanov.
On Friday, Mr P.S. thought that another medala dream was dreamed out on Friday morning.
100 metres of barriers in the race and the high slowness of Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa was behind her personal record.
But there are five disciplines.
After a 10-year period, "Porgijs and Besa" in Liepaja.
In Latvia, Porgijs and Besa was in Latvia in 1973 in the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised voice has not been brought to the fore once again.
That is why the Cheese Festival and the organisers of the Liepaja Arts Forum have decided, in close cooperation, to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy the voice of George Gäršvina.
"It is a great pleasure for us that, after a 10-year break, when the most recent case in Liepaja could have enjoyed an initial study in Liepaja and Besa in the new, newly-found concert hall," said Giba Bože, the head of the concert concert in Lielais dzintars, Baiba Bože, head of the concert hall.
Porgijs and Besa "is a vivid musical story of love, its volatility, passion, and household tragedies and ordinary everyday proposals.
It reflects Afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this operation, the exclusion of this tolerance makes it so liveable.
"And yes, this mystery is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and really deep," says the director Viesturs Kairo.
What I like most - listening to or bringing this operation into line always include the famous melody, the famous motives, the famous motives, but this transition from one nature to another through the light of one person or another person or the orchestra or orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this construction," the operation shall be assessed by the "Porgijs and Besa" concert for a concert, "he said.
Operators are in agreement that this is a major development.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear the famous Garoshvina operation in the world.
It is good that Liepaja can just feel the world's elite.
"He's a professional," the operation shall be assessed by Edgars Lama.
The concert study was specific to the fact that the newly-identified concert hall was first played by orchestra and a first concert concert.
Farmers on the museum museum could be named Jaman Rozental.
Riga Vice-President, Andris Ameriks Rozental said that the museum's address could not be a major feature of the European Union, "said Vejonis Vedema 10a, but Jaman Rozental 1.
The Muzeja Director, Mar Lotce, admitted that the registration of the address would lead to a considerable bureaucratic burden on the whole, but generally welcomes this idea and has therefore accepted the municipality's proposal.
The Riga City of Riga has put this idea in 1936 by creating a Burkarda Dzeň Monument, which stands at the museum of Burkarda Dzeň, which stands at the museum.
The then museum's Director, Vilhelms, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little anxious for me all the time - but the County County, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr Americans, promise to think..." said Lotce.
The National Museum of Arts following an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation of the National Arts.
This week, the VEF will start the reconstruction of the Culture Castle.
A total of around €11 million will be updated by Walve.
The renovation of a number of Palace Spaces, including two radar medicines, and to adapt buildings to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to mobilise a European Union fund of six million euros, but the Director of the Riga City Council Oleg Burov acknowledges that there is still no complete clarity about European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to launch the renovation of VEF's cultural renovation through the mobilisation of the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months of decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, it will be the money allocated or not," Burovs said.
In December last year, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that it will take the decision that Brussels does not take a decision.
We now see another circle of discussion, let us see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council is, without doubt, guaranteed that this process will be launched and completed within the deadlines," Burovs said.
As reported, in March 2015, the VEF's Castle Castle Castle Castle Castle Castle of Culture.
Although the year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively in unsuitable conditions.
The Riga City Council's VEF's strategy for the renovation of the VEF's Cultural Palace is divided into supposedly independent rebuilding work, where everyone will ensure the different functions of the Castle.
First: Increasing the availability of the EWF and the development of the surrounding area.
It provides for the orderly building and engineering of the building and rebuilding of the building.
Second: Improving the supply of cultural Castle services.
It plans the building of a building, a wall and a ceiling for restaurants, audio and audio recordings, as well as the orderly building of the building's internal engineering.
Third: Improving the collective working conditions of Creative Officers, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.

This year, of course, I am watching what happens in the world and try to respond to it.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Evangelical message must be put at the heart of life.
It has to be demonstrated that the Gospel is responsible for the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for a further road.

According to the story of the cameras, the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour when no one has left anyone to know about the bloody man, he has been robbed by a garden.
Around 90 minutes after the crackdown event, police and victim were taken to hospital where the injuries were injured.
Referring to his candidacy to the State Revenue Service's head of the State Revenue Service, Inga Koleggova, head of the State Environmental Service, has escaped the government from falling into poverty, the Latvian University Institute of Social Sciences, Professor Obes Skudra.
The explanations of the Kolegoal on the withdrawal of the candidacy in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
Scudra told LETA that he was difficult to imagine that the government would support Kolegova's candidacy at the government meeting on Unity next week.
As a result, if the Ministers of Unity vote against, but Kolegolov would have been confirmed as a result of the government's demission.
The expert also considers that Kolegova has consulted both the Finance Ministers, Daniel Reiznieci-Ozolu and Prime Minister Mari Močinski.
At the same time, it was an increase in the 'Unity', which strongly opposed her candidacy.
As a result of the tendering of a competitive candidate, the Smarra said there were two options: either a compromise figure will be selected, or the Authority will continue to chair Dace Peleka.
At the same time, he notes that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that there is no other candidate, it is a household of Pelethical, that there should not be a tender.
Kolegova has confirmed that Kolegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the vacant post of the Revenue Service.
As a result of the 'Unity' objection, the government postponed the approval of Koleggoa in the post of the Revenue Service.
Following a decision by the government, Kolegova confirmed that it was still ready to become the head of the VID.
At a later date, however, the idea was changed: on Friday, the Finance Minister, Danai Reizniece-Ozlai said that she was withdrawing her consent to move to the post of head of the Revenue Service and that she had no easy choice.
Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis's spokesperson Andrejs Vaivars told LETA that a new competition will be organised for the vacant post of the Revenue Service.

For the media, the renowned road section.
Vetikle minister Uldis Augulis, VAS Latvian State roads (LVC), as well as the construction company Binders and local representatives of the construction company Binders, and representatives of local authorities today opened the reconstructed country's main road (Grebins) - Rnezne-Daugavpils-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (A13) to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163.05).
The road is a country's visit, especially border paths, and it is therefore particularly welcome to identify the reconstruction phase with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the main roads of the country is improving.
"As the forecasts suggest, the means available on the roads will be achieved in 2018 and we must think how to keep the most busy roads in a very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis.
The Transport Minister also pointed out that the proposals made by road traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented in government.
The construction works between the hunt and the Lithuanian border (156,4-163.05), the SIA Binders started last year and continued this year after the technological break.
The cost of the Reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT) the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"At this stage, the road design has been fully restored and repairs will start next year from hunts to Daugavpilij next year, which will put the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpilij," said LVC Chairman Janis Lange.
The main road roads of the country are most congested and, by 2018, we intend to ensure that all the national motorways are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain the good quality by providing for the timely maintenance of periodic maintenance and to carry out a halt to the asphalt every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding and all the expectations look at the proposals made by the expert group to align the road financing system," Mr Lange said.
As part of the project, road connections and the lighting of the Medality Centre.
Workly underground work: four phases of large scale decoupling and large-scale inscription and embankment works, smoothing out the path of the road, which was so far very uneven.
A renewed public transport space and a new area of return for public transport.
In the past, the road had insufficient capacity and locality in the mountains due to the mountainous valley and the old road to a common terrain.
The next construction season is planned to restore the road section from the town of Daugavpils to the reconstruction phase (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, the LVC intends to carry out various types of works more than 1 100 km of national roads.
For all the renovations planned on the national road network this year are available on the LVC homepage.
"In order to achieve the desired effects of weight reduction, the right choice of combinations of food products is of great importance," he said.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when our own fruits are fresh fruit, berries and vegetables.
The combination of malnutrition products can help not only to reduce overweight but also to contribute to a targeted promotion of the various organism processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, as it provides a lasting sense of the satellites and helps to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Certificate have shown that the label has a positive impact on glucose blood and help us to feel encouraged.
Cajena pipari and protein wealthy meals, such as poultry meat or proteins, not only creates a sense of satiety, but also reduces the likelihood of large meals in subsequent meals.
Such a combination of meals is also able to increase the amount of calories incineration to 35%.
Studies show that Cajena pipari can help to get rid of the fats of the fats.
The Orange contains metabolised nutrients: choline is a good source of vitamins in Vitamin.
Due to a sufficient quantity of these nutrients, the level of cortical levels may be reduced, and the accumulation of fat around the body middle.
The bird with fresh berries is another source of a long and fats of fats, which is worth mentioning in their menu.
Fines and berries contain fibre which, according to the Canadian scientific conclusions, is controlled by a glance, an intimate hormone, and thus a sense of hungry.
In addition, the oils contain polyphenols which are half-weight in weight reduction and does not allow fatty fats.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to work miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of creating a sense of the edge.
Vegetables contain water and fibre, and therefore contributes to the sense of the scourge.
At the same time, proteins are slowing down the process of ruminant and provides a sense of slight for a longer period.
You can eat a chicken with a salt or to prepare the cocktails of proteins from the finished bag and enjoy it together with its favourite vegetables.
Some product combinations are avoided.
In fruit, there are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch which is in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit was mechanically separated, while chemically discarded it up to the third or fourth grades in the grubbing-up process.
The victim will be divided into three different phases which are already in the mouths.
It is therefore essential not to eat the sweet after the meal.
By building a sweet meal immediately after the meal, it is "trapped" in the stomach with other meals where it is not chemically digested and is beginning to be blowing.
Do not eat maize, potatoes, horses, bananas, files or other carbohydrates with citrus, happiline, inanasites or other acids.
Ensemium ptialine, which is in the wall, operates only in the alkaline environment.
In addition to the removals of carbohydrates, but also contributes to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs, cheese and cheese, meat and milk, eggs and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar proteins and combinations of milk and similar proteins in one meal.
Their processing requires different grey juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and time of entry into the stomach.
Arczs, hungry, musiblack and other melons must always be eaten separately from other meals.
Melones are not digested if they are in the stomach with other foods.
At the same time, the combination of proteins with proteins.
The people make a good mix of suffering, but the same cannot be said of fat and proteins - fat prevents the removal of proteins.
Olbalins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of proteins is consumed, avoid the use of fat at all.
This also applies to fresh, it is not advisable to combine large quantities of nuts (contains proteins) with a whole source (contains fat).
Such a combination shall prevent the effective reduction of weight.
How can we be better prepared?
"The cooking, thermic treatment causes significant loss of nutrients: around 15% to 55% of the original nutritional composition of the products" said God.
In most cases, nutrients are going to waste in water in water.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods is increasing, with a direct weakness.
In this case, it would be advisable to use the soup paint: in this case, you will not lose nutrients left in water and eat them later.
Vegetables should also be prepared by asking them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of opopine containing tomatoes.
In the case of tomatoes, the amount of opcene will increase by 25%.
The despair of betaflag, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, carrots, sweets, sweets, sweeteners and refineries.
The treatment of eggs and meat shall take away the natural characteristics of existing proteins, making them more easily removable.
The treatment of meat and eggs also makes the railways and other mineral substances present more easily into the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, the freezing of the fibre shall not be affected.
The combination of the pulp with tomatoes may increase the reception of iron into a body which, in turn, provides for a better brain and muscular activity.
Our organism takes up to 33% less un-blood iron to be found in products such as bean, sheets, cereals, cereals, than blood-producing iron, which is found in animal products like beef, fish and chicken.
You can considerably increase the absorption of non-blood fertile iron in an organism through the use of non-blood products containing nutrients, together with vitamins, tomatoes, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change the un-bloodshed iron in such a way that our organism is more easily absorbed by our body.
Rails are necessary for the production of chemoglobal, which provides oxygen supply in muscular and brains.
For the maximum benefit of the salts, add a healthy fat, such as olive or flaseed-oil.
When we prepare the butter with reading, add to the rich salmon or sardine of unadditives that are a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium calcium and has a significant role to play in the formation of bone formation.
Auza (as well as other gracereal products), together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, upwards, avenues and other fruit or coal, help to stabilise cholesterol levels, and avoid wasting arteries.
Snapchat 'Anime' is criticized for the sickness carriages
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators argue that this is racist inaffection.
With this lump effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality on a daily basis and to play its own identity in a absurd manner.
You could turn yourself into ananagans, dog or image that would derive the Roja Lihshten<unk> glezna.
The lake is spray, pictures of imaging, which generates more than 30 million transformations on a day.
Any error is rapidly made public.
Snapchat cheap effects have already been criticised in the past, with the discarding that the app is propagated for too black or bright skin skins as an ideal beauty.
This week, the new cheap effects which enable users to turn their eyes, splitters and shoes were released this week, and some critics called it a racist naked caricature - "yellow gigs."
It was also a question of whether such contradictions indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
"The Verge" and "Motherboard" said the slowness of the "The Verge" and "Motherboard" said that the slow effect has been taken out of the application.
The company explained that the cheapest goal is to portray the Anime fathers rather than caring the people of Asia.
However, people who have experienced racism have recalled the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarity with Anime.
In an American Art Study, the American artistic study, Greisas Sparapani posted a wide resonance in the E-mail letter, she points out that the cheap effect is "insulting and inconvenient" to say more. "
She added that it is difficult not to keep sight of the apparent similarity between the caricatures and the cheap effect.
It shows that the cheap effect is not simply a yellow face, but the yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
The American culture is also involved in the never-ending fight for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and devices that we use every day.
Snapchat's large group of young people, representing different race, unlike older people, is more vulnerable to such things.
If Snapchat lenses set up a picture that insults users, then 'nowadays do not remain unnoticed today, "Keitir Zou said in an interview.
On Thursday, the head of the Medium Products Products, has been erased and recommended that others do the same.
In her article "Medium" and she explained in a telephone interview that she feared that the problem of a race arises as a result of the Snapchat employment policy, which does not provide sufficient support for racial diversity.
He criticised the management of the company, consisting mainly of white men and then concluded their article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in an enterprise, so there are some other members of the company, but they do not take up a position in order to be able to express their views in a safe and convenient manner."
Her voice also agrees with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal the number of employees representing different race, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but his representative found that the company was co-owned by a staff specialists, who will focus on the representation of racial minorities, which is not widely represented and will facilitate the participation of the company.
On the other hand, I am not renewing their Snapchat account, adding: 'I wonder whether they really need more users like us to realise that this is wrong. "
The Congress of Congress states that reports of the Islamic State have missed the reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress of Congress states that representatives of the US Central order distorted the reports by depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than in actual fact.
The analysts of the Central Service of the Central Command of the Intelligence Committee, the Committee on Intelligence and the Defence Finance Subcommittee's Temporary Committee, stating that their leadership was controlled by reports of the Americans' progress in the fight against the Islamic State of the Islamic State.
The Central Commander, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report says that the intelligence reports, confirmed by senior leaders of the High-rang Centcom leaders, reflects the US's fight against terrorism more positively than in actual fact. Facts were regularly distorted, with better achievements than other intelligence analyses.
Kalifornian Republican representative Kens Kalverts said: "Centcom's act is unacceptable: our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports'.
Ventcom management errors are in the top management of the organisation.
This 10-page report presents a detailed picture of the current problems in the presentation and analysis of the Central Commander on the efforts of the Americans to prepare Iraq in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide irrefutable evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration had missed the reports, it shows that the management of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to display a more optimistic view of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that on the first half of 2015, the statements and reports of the Central Administration of the Central Administration in the first half of 2015, the statements and reports to Congress illustrated the situation in a much more positive light than was actually true.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that the Mosul Recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Maiks Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party, said in his report: "A series of months of investigations are clear '.
Between mid-2015 and mid-2015, the main officials of the US Central Administration distorted the reports by depicting the threat of ISIS in Iraq than they were in fact.
The Republican Party established a working group knowing that the analysts are concerned that the information on the Islamic State is being misrepresented.
The report will be followed by a new discovery in this case, according to the report released on Thursday.
The Ministry of Defence has carried out investigations into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday made its own report in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party Task Force.
In his report, the Democratic Representative of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Centcom) in his report, Centcom too limited the preparation of the reports by the intelligence services in the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Force.
Mr Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information," said the analyst and "spread the truth of the truth."
But Shars and Democratic Party members added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports, according to the "predetermined or political position."
The Daily Beast published the provisional results of the Congress's investigation on Thursday.
The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Inspectorate launched an investigation after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
He said that the Pentagon spokesman Patrik Evans said that the Pentagon would not comment on the congress report as long as the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data and the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence Authority call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about the issue of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports by the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Critick of Islamic State intelligence reminds the Islamic State intelligence of more than ten years when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs Huker published a study saying that the Bush administration launched a Afghan War with too little thought of its possible consequences.
He also played a major role in the opening of the Islamic State Intelligence issue.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hukkera team revealed that in contrast to public reports, air strikes in the Islamic State oil factories have not seriously undermined the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Administration.
At the moment, the Centcom commander General Loids Ostins III received sharp criticism because many lawmakers believed that the war reports describe the situation too positively.
In April General Ostar Ostins retired and replaced by General Jobzefs L. Votels.
In the US, the US has a female hockey hockey in the United States, which has been the fourth consecutive victory.
A day after Japan scored the first two goals in the first two goals of the United States "team for the first two goals in the first two goals of the US team's team in a 3-0 win over the first two goals.
The five gate gates in two games are an informable achievement, but in the 27-year-old Bama said that it was not possible to remember whether she had already succeeded in the past.
She said: "I have no idea."
I am not out of the people who number their gates.
But she knows that the Americans' result in the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them no distinction in their group with Britain, which, on Thursday, has won a 2-0 victory over Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to refute the first round of the last game.
Both teams have already qualified a quarter of the game and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the team team and the second.
The first prize winner will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch sample that is the leader of the second group.
As well as the game of Saturday, the Americans have already plunged the storm four years ago in London four years ago in London.
The team was also in Bama
She upaugurated in Blub, the lion's hockey hockey in his first three years of age (her parent pains had already worked with this sports style in the Drecsell) and the national extradition when she was 16 years old, becoming the most recent player in the history of the youngest players.
She did not go to the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not enter the finger.
However, 2012 was a failed year for her and her team.
In the next year, English Kregs Parhama was appointed and everything changed to the right half.
It was called "cultural, mentality and physical change."
In London, we did not invest as much as it is now.
We have changed everything.
Bama found the result in the first half of the week with the hemicycle in the first half of the season.
The game was launched without a victory in its accounts, but their selection was very brilliant and kept a minimal result of the 0: 1 to the end of the third period when Bama was rescored.
She started a bomb in the area around the square, she saw the middle of the square and send a bomb to the GMP.
On the fourth part of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalesa was still in the middle of the fourth period.
It was the first team of the US Guard Guard Bruges Bruges, in each of the first three games.
She has come to the skin.
It is also the case that Bama.
"We are going very well at the moment," said Pahama, but how good it is to show the game on Saturday.
The most depressive meal of the depression period
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the President, French-Delano Rigfish sat in the oval room in order to keep the meals.
The Presidential President Rugfish has passed a delicate culinary delicate as a geese star or a fueland of Merille and Merilenda turtles.
On the other hand, his meal was much more modest: crowd of egg tomato, potato and desert potatoes.
James Ziegelmane says: "This is a way of showing solidarity with people who have been very hard off."
Her husband, Andre Kohl said: "It is also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The rest of the Brooklyn Heights is a day historian historians.
In the last book, "Sauzeņu Dry" described the Chinese kitchen in America, but Ziegelmane describes the life through the meal in the eastern downstream of Manhattan.
His new joint work, "The Intelligent Maltese," which will be published on Tuesday in Harper, is a story of the Americas at the time of the Great Depression.
By showing some solidarity in the culinia, they stopped a meal together in the reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch building located in the Flatin district and operates from 1929, when the great depression started.
For 54 years, Mrs Ziegelmane ordered butter with froy cheese and the olive olive oves, while 57 years old Kou ordered the turbulent, the potato and the vegetable island.
When the reporter ordered a fake green, a couple of people admitted that his choice was very appropriate to the conversation about the Great Depression Day.
Mrs Ziegelmane said that the falsified green green was very popular.
There was a land green, a liver green and a birds green.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other components that enriched the meals.
It has been thought, as it is - to overshadow so much land, so that they would be half a day.
Mr Kou had been blamed.
"It's probably the stomach to be perfect," he said.
In the first few years, the American lunch has been similar to the Swede's table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat their men and men and brocastle, lunch and dinner have been given fresh coup.
In the first World War, it was Americans who sent Europeans the meal.
"At that time, the diet became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," said Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write exactly about this subject.
It was just as important for the new budget diet: unknown meals such as the fake green and sautouts became a "great way of using surpluses," Ziegelmane said, because the pack was able to hide the unattractive ingredients below the cream.
The fruit of fruit was replaced by cheap fruit.
Meat, which was the main ingredient of the Americans for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury.
At a time when the number of calories and cooking was more important than taste, new, unseen formation.
In a long-standing book, Mrs Ziegelmane found a recipe to produce petty butter.
Mr Kou said: "This was not a popular addition to the dinner of the lunch.
Mrs Ziegelmane emphasizes: 'It was real.'
There is a lack of compatibility between the Earth and the bread butch.
Many of the household eating recipes applied to difficult times.
A household economists, like Luese Stenley, the head of the Federal Economic Office of the households of 1923 to 1943 established a national eating habits that were not before the Great Depression, not before the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that housewives become 'economists' and take challenges such as turning into mackerel and mackerel microphone.
"The Intelligent Maltese" means a history of historic spirits.
Evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Huver, let me eat a cake.
Even though he said publicly about his elementary childhood and canteens in Aiova, in fact he eaten as a fine millionaire that he had become.
Mr Kou said: "He liked the European kitchen, for example, with cucumbers'.
He was eating nearly a gold in the butter, walking over lunch.
He was completely divorced from reality.
President Rigfish would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleonora would not have recommended an example with his eating habits.
It was said in the book that Rigfish was a domestic servant who did not teach to eat, thus the White Nams became a place 'where not only was one of the most inspiring meals in Washington, but also the worst pains. "
As soon as the national economy recluded, most of the depression of convenience has disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrient, as well as how to use science in gastronomy, added Ziegelmane.
The rest tells us that when they write a book, they gained a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs Ziegelmane, for example, why she was not able to discard the food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the day," said Kohl.
Mrs Ziegelmane said: 'She actually put people at the heart'.
There was an incident with wind melting.
When we eat the Eisenberga estuary, a couple of writers would be deserted from the Finns home: the plate of the plate, which President Rigfish used to eat in lunch.
"It is a flu poam," said Mrs Ziegelmane said, adding that at the time it was a habit that had been distributed to modest meals.
It does not have a vacuum, only dried floods, a little meal, sugar, water and canal.
All the unsolicited crackdown on the flat massacre that came to the plate.
As a matter of urgency, it was not so bad.
Mr Kou has been overshadowed by some coumbersus.
After listening to a experienced "economist," he said.
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck on Hepatitis C patents
A magistrate has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the services paid by it in the Hepatitis C patent against Merck & Co Inc. "
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of the 200 million pounds for the forging of two Merck patents threatened with the successful Sound and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found irregularities in Merk's activities, such as meting after the transfer of the oath and other unethical practices.
At the hearing on Thursday, the US judge, Bets Labsons Frmens pointed out that Gilead had the right to request compensation for legal expenses incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to get positions on the market against Gilead, which is dominated by the new generation of Hepatitis C, which is effective in 90% of the liver disease.
The case was launched already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained one another in trying to obtain ownership of the newly developed active components, which is a key component of Gilead and Merck.
The forces supported by the US say that they have completely overtaken control of the city of Manbidj from Islamic State.
US forces in the north of the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the latest Islamic State soldiers have fled the city, the spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDS) is currently cleaning the city from the last opponent of the former opponents who have not left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages of civilians who had been captured by the militants, the news agency Reuters said Sharfans Darvian from the SDS's military council.
"At the moment, the city is under our full control and we are conducting a militant search," he said.
Clinton's income in 2015 has reached 10.75 million dollars and paid a couple of euros to a federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released the 2015 tax declaration, which shows that the presidential candidate and her husband and her husband earned 10.75 million dollars in this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to his Clinton charity organisation, former president Bill Clinton earned around $5.3 million, insisting on a spotlight and former State Secretary for State's work on the work of the State Departa, published in cooperation with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's electoral allies, US Senator Timin Keins and his wife Anna Holtone published his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tims Kevin continue to set new standards of financial transparency," Clinton said in her statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind the various pretexts and reservations, so as not to keep the promises to disclose their tax information.
The publication of nominal tax information is a record practice for the US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
Trump and his lawyers say the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason to unopen tax information.
"Greater march," said Clinton's campaign for Democratic Party candidate Ians Sams said.
On Thursday, Trump's specific adviser, Maikls Kohens, said CNN, that he will not allow Trump to publish tax information before they have finished the audits.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican people say his refusal raises questions about his real property, the amount of donations and other business commitments, including Russia.
Clinton crushed the oil poll on Friday, where several influential Republican officials claim Trump to publish their tax information.
She returned to this issue again in Michigana on Thursday.
She said to the crowd: "He is refusing to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
"Politico" says that in the course of the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes at all, and the New York Times Business Column said that many books and lawyers believed that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the Bild Bafeta Bafeta, the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year is due to pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, during the Clinton speeches in Omaha, Nebraskie, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
The Bafets said that he also has an income service audit and Trump is afraid of voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has made tax information up to 2007.
Clinton is now living in Chieva, New York and the period 2007 to 2014, the average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and the total tax rate of around 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Review shows that, unlike the majority of Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are wage.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, of which the Clinton has received $1.109,000 in dividends.

Jurmala filmmaker criticises the hotel in Berlin on the closing of the Israeli-Palestinian Round at the request of a Araba.
The film's French film maker broke the storm in social media when it transpired that Kempinski Bristol in Berlin is not available in the hotel in Berlin.
Klods Lancmans, documentaries of Shoah, Klogd Lancman, Kempinski Bristol, Kempinski Bristol, the hotel and the address of the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit to Lancman, Lancmans tried to find a list of Israelis on the list offered by the Israeli DPD.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries to which they can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been swept away and destroyed?
Raksta Lancman
Instead, Kempinski Bristol is offering to call the country through its call centre.
The Relaissance requested an explanatory statement from the hotel staff.
The Lancman writes that the reply received "was shocked."
The hotel administrator said that "it was a deliberate hotel management decision."
The reason for the removal of the code was even more prevalent by film directors.
"Most guests are Arabs and asked for the eviction of the Israeli code," said Lancmans cite the interpretation of the hotel.
The Russian Ambassador in Germany, Jakovs Had-Handelsmans said that the Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jakovs Hadas-Handelsmans.
We are astonished and shocked about this incident.
That is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, it is in this hotel network that is even more humiliated.
There is no need for clarification.
"We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event was quite extensive on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel was simply natural for the Arab world.
Another story said the "shame" said that the hotel is in Kurfurstendamm near synagoogai.
Der Spiegel says that the hotel has quickly rejected all the allegations, stating that it was all "misunderstood" and apologised to Lancmanam.
"We have not received a direct removal of Israel from the national numbering list," Sudan deutsche Zeitung cite Kempinski.
And I would add that the code is again added to the list.
Poland uses rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters in Brazil.
The police and police collision took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in the demonstrations against the reforms of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problem started when the law attempted to exert students, leading to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students were present in Demonstration to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of Sanpaula Geraldo Alckmina proposes close to 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools with a view to saving savings.
Some demonstrators branded on walls with messages against the temporary President Maiklu Temeru.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations for expressing support for the exhibition of President Dilma Rousefai, which was voted in the Senate.
Teacher Keliners finishes the first, returning Britain's gold medals in cycling
Sir Skiners from Scottish finishes the first team of men's cyclists in Rio bicks last night.
The 23-year-old player from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making it a proud legacular school of Seru Krisu Hoju and abolishing the victory for the favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago Britain had a surprising victory when the Holy scored a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it in the World Championship in London, although Holy has already finished his career.
The problem was between the Beijing and London Olympics, since it had to replace the experienced starting team James Ifu.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When the Holy took the floor, his seat was tried to fill Chişinău and Mets Krampton.
The British coachers met the Skinse, seeing the potential that he has shown later.
Hindes, Kenyan, a champion which was in the top four years ago with Hoe and Sciners, who had a record of Olympic qualifications, but a better start was the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindes were in close contact with the Kenyan leadership and the Skiners safeguarded this leadership.
The change in the strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes drove with more carry-overs to allow Kenyan and, in particular, the Skink to go faster.
The Holy said as a representative of the BBC and skinned Skinera, Kenyan and Hindesa when they grew at the honour of the honour.
The 23-year-old glass said: "It was an unspeakable honour '.
I do everything to defend my name.
In the Far, we set the Olympic record and winning World Championships.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better win.
After the victory, together with Kenya and Holland Olympics in London in 2012, Hindes will know that the net fell to the wounds after the failed start.
Later, he refuted the comment and the British rivals were not able to prove otherwise.
This was not the case at this time.
Hindes said: "Britain's flags were remembered in London."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a team for the last 3 months.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the Olympic Games were indeed a special player.
One medals will say a country which won seven of the ten gold medals in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team scoreboard over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In the light of the Kenyan outcome, he could indeed repeat the success of Hoja in obtaining the three Olympic gold medals.
For the Kenyan industry, it would mean six fugitive gold and one silver medals.
The Holy is also born on this day.
Kenyan, the next races are a sprint which starts today and will continue today.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I simply enjoy all of this at the moment.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because it can win together with the team members.
If you are honest, you won a little alone. "
Hindes said: "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as a arm."
On that day it was the only battle for medals, but they were not the only good news for Britain.
Sers Bredlium Vigin, Eds Klensium, Stalin and Oveins Douls showed the highest qualification time for four kilometres of four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The world record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the finest will take place today on the second half of the day, where the Vigiline will certainly be at the heart of the focus.
Yesterday, before a qualification trip, he had no agreement with the Commission when he was summoned by judges to measure his soils.
The Women's Day, which will continue today, Laura Trota, Djoanna Rovsela Šanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Archibalda from Milan.
The British delegation hopes that the British bicycle team will champion the medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, all expect the same achievements in Rio as well.
In the meantime, the scene has gone in different ways, after the accusations in sectarian and insulting, the technical director of the Holy and Viktoria Bendleton.
However, when we started the first bicycle race, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Cup is becoming uncertain, as the ambitious agreement has been terminated.
The future of the Aluminium Cup and the future of hundreds of its employees in Portlenda, has become unclear because its main customer has announced the interruption of cooperation.
The announcement is based on the plans of the Government of Victoria to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20 years of subsidies will be cut off in November.
As a result, over 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
It could be up to 2000 both direct and indirect jobs.
Moreover, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the cabinet consumes around 10 percent of the entire supply of Viktoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point of Point Henry Henry, which led to the interruption of the operation of the English power station.
The Port Portlenda Cup works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation on the rise of the value of the dollar and the cost of plant production.
The industrial energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from his own Loy Yang A power station in Latrouba Ieleya, says that the other three owners are likely to interrupt their contracts.
Most power plants belong to Alcoa and Alumia clusters, in addition to the company's company CITIC and Marubeni Corp.
"AGL" looks forward to continuing the Portlenda plant, which would mean further energy supply melting, "said its representative.
"AGL" said contracts were the so-called "risk restrictive contracts" to enter into force in November 2016.
The Treaties have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL" intends to receive revenue from these contracts in 2017, "said the company's representative.
From 2018 onwards, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
"AGL" says that, in its forecasts, there has already been a loss of $187 million in its forecasts, with the result that these contracts will be interrupted.
Alcoa says Alcoa that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue the operation of the Cup or to supply it energy.
The US company says that in 2010 it has concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be stopped; the company does not explain why it will suspend its cooperation.
Analysts have raised concerns about the possible closure of the Portland Cup in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, due to the weak economy.
AGL CEO Stves Mikelsons said last week that 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megavatus is used in Portlenda in Portlenda and Tomago 900 megawatts.
If both these factories were to leave the energy market, energy demand would fall considerably.
And this would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year, with a decrease in the budget, the situation could deteriorate.
Three out of five people in Queen, mostly retired, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal evictions, refuse free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only become worse as a result of the cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Faresen, Director of the Legal Centre for Queensland, said that the latest National Law Centre for the National Law of the National Law Centre said that thousands of people in need of legal aid are currently refused legal aid.
Mr Fares Farels pointed out that if this decision is not reversed, the situation would only become worse.
He also says: 'The Queen's legal centre is constantly under-funded, which means that aid is refused to thousands of people in need. "
People who seek to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debt, families living in divorce, workers who are dishonest: all those people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding of 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without aid.
We call on the Attorney General and the Senator of Queen, the Senator, and the Senator of Queen, to immediately stop the cuts in funding, so that people in need of legal aid can obtain it.
Last year the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the state level.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and the Palazčuka Government to invest in this important area.

A new tradition - a gay and sports festive in Stalin.
On Saturday, the first time people were pulled into the guest and sports festivals for the first time.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that the Ezer will no longer be.
A new page has now been moved.
The day began with sporting competitions.
This time, the race was not in traditional form and too serious, because, for example, the shooting were to be met in the guise, the boat airport, with the man's hand, the "bumbucling" of the left, "the bumboury of the left, the" bumbucling "in general was not at all the same Olympic Games.
However, each participant could show how strong, brave, good and attacked he is.
After a sports match, everybody pulled in a free way where the pacible started.
In the meantime, the "child corner," where small were able to descend into the crowds and to obtain a new image in the seabed.
The new, which could also become a tradition, was the debt of wheelling, which gave both tractors and motorcycles.
All was addressed by Inga Kadiís, head of the government of Kirkuk, who ordered a fine rest and a dry time, rainly rained, but rained, but it was not much hamper.
It continued with the most recent people in Stalin's recent population.
It is a good thing that the course has been completed with five girls and one teenager.
In the run-up to the brickers, the "Rudens Vee" of the various peoples "Rudens" Rudens "Rudens" Rudens "Rudens" Rudens, the "Autonomous" of the various peoples' defeat 'Older buy'.
And that is that there was a glance at a glance as well.
Of course, local people and memories were delighted to be the famous actor Jānis Jarans and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Nabina Nabina and Krcanina, as well as the children of the Children's Family.

Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we put a huge amount of work to make all the national regions of the country from the Olympic Games.
The work of the Working Forums and the Suspends won an enormous amount of Olympic Games.
And we will do this again by providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities near Hile.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow neighbourhood.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too high and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said Britain will never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be global dumping.
Skepticians were wrong for 2012 and also in the case of Heathrow, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles that have to be overcome, but Heathrow has all overcome.
Like the Olympic Games, Chile is a draft infrastructure project which will benefit society as a whole and not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the soil for both employment and experience in this airport and Britain.
Heathrow works a great team, which has created a 11 billion pounds for infrastructure investment in the world, starting with a terminal of 5, which has been named as the best airport terminal in the world and finally with the terminal 2 built between two more intense routes in the world.
Now they are ready to establish a third run-off which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London Olympics 2012 was a great success and I am confident that this will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Economic Minister for Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman is hurt on the great road, trying to commit suicide.
The remaining night in the midnight of the night.
The police are trying to find witnesses in an accident when it drove over a number of cars on the road.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight to A1 near Morges from the Morges city of Morges.
The police report said that a desperate wish to commit to suicide was missed, a woman had gone on the road in the dark where several cars drove.
By trying to kill themselves, the victims, the 49 year-old ushers, drove several cars, including heavy machinery.
She died in the event of the event.
A number of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, while others have not yet been clarified, says the police who are calling for the drivers and the witnesses of the accident.
The case has also started a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, for the benefit of Le Tribune de Geneve, a lawyer, said.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers said: "It will be clarified by the public."
The two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrians' night had gone on the road, so it was decided that drivers could not foresee a pedestrians on the middle of the night.
Last year, a policeman was justified in killing behind a neglect when she droved a man on the A1 road near Paijernes in August 2014.
The Court found that the 22 year old was drunk and subsequently noticed to go on the road.
The Court concluded that a policeman who was on the way to an accident, travelled in an appropriate manner and a judge admitted that a man on the road was "an entirely unforeseeable and extraordinary case."
Anyone with information on the incident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
The Internet is collecting signatures for the organisation of a new head of the Revenue Service.
The Avaaz.org portal has been launched for the organisation of a new Vehicle Service (SRS) for the organisation of a new Public Service Service (SRS).
In a petition addressed to the National Alliance (NA) and the Greens / Farmers' Union (Greens / Farmers) said that the public wants a transparent and professional nomination process.
The petition was set up on August 10 and has now been signed by 55 people.
The nomination process for the Revenue Service's Director General Ingas Koleggoa is untransparent and unprofessional.
It recalls the best functioning of the best Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again make public disillusionment in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a contest with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the text of the petition is needed.
Its author, Janis B. pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria for the selection of Kolegova.
It is also clear what the candidates are for the Revenue Service's work in the VID.
He said that the State Chancellery should make a new, open competition, which is actively addressed by professional candidates, personalised selection experts and appropriate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola formally nominated Kolegolov as head of the Revenue Service, the government was set to approve her new post, but all the party Unity ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, so I played a bad game.
Alexander Samoilovs and Jānis Samoilovs had hoped for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, but there is no difference in the event of the tournament.
One of the world's most powerful beaches of the world, on Thursday, the top of the world's most powerful beaches of the world, with 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15) lost the Brazilian Evanian Gonzar Oliveira and Pee Solbergam Sale Sale, closing its participation in the four most important sports forums.
In the three subgroups, Latvian athletes won one win, but it was even two more couples.
It was the ratio of the three small points of small points, which, after this massacre, was the most disadvantaged in Latvia's durability.
"In the first half, we were behind the 16: 15.
Even I do not know how the remaining part of this season left unpoints.
It must not be played.
After that, everything was in order and it could have been a good basis for the third season and it should have been a good basis for the third season.
We started along the same lines, but after the parties changed, the result was only one commander.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the group, all teams were similar, nearly all the cameras had three sessions, so it was important that the small points were important.
"You need to play a more similar role than to return to 3-4 points in a row," he said.
We know that the Evane can be preserved.
"At the end of the first season, 1-2 points, while the third to + 4 had already gone to him," Steinmeier said.
We tried to show the best game.
The wins came up with a wonderful moment.
I did not look at the situation before the discovery, but it was known that there were as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, I'm sorry," Samoilovs said.
From Evancane, there were good servers and it was also quite good for the first six, but the third is open to the third and it was difficult to form an attack.
On the other hand, I went far wrong with Pecanserves, but it was to deal with it.
Samoilovs said that, unlike the previous match today, sportsmen were not nervous today.
"We played a game," he said.
"They played a good game at the end and in the end."
Before the tournament we said immediately that the loose is the most inconvenient one.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even out of the group.
"All of us waited a medals and we also had a lot of things, but there is no longer a difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilovs, who predicted that dozen will continue to play in the future.
I think that the issue will not be and will continue to play together, because this is just one affair.
Samoilovam Rioon-Weiro was already in a third Olympic career, since in 2008 he was in Beijing in 2008 with the Maltese Powson, but four years ago in London with Ruslane Sorokina.
In the meantime, this was the second beginning of the Olympic Games.
Latvia is also following the opening of the gas market from the potential of the potential trader.
The Latvian energy company Latvijas energo follows the process of opening the gas market, both from the consumer and the potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere said.
"The decision on whether a gas market model and a legal framework will be established for the gas market.
"For that reason, he said," I believe that the European Union should play a key role in the development and commentation of the laws, as well as his proposals. "
The Agency already wrote that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in collaboration with the Public Service Regulation Commission and the Energy Company, Latvijas Gaze established the draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers "rules" which will modify the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market, ensuring that natural gas customers are free to choose the natural gas customers.
When working on the new regulation on the market in natural gas, the aim is to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and for the user to understand.
For this reason, as the most effective and user-friendly solution, the "trader's central model" whereby all activities relating to customer service are provided by the trader, one contract, one bill and one single information and servicing place, leaving the distribution system operator to the technical issues of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
Recalling that the gradual opening of the market for household customers, including household customers, who will not wish to choose another natural gas seller, will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming connected users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to the users of natural gas at a regulated price," the ministry said.
For their part, economic operators will have to choose a natural gas trade contract with which the natural gas trade agreement is to be concluded.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade contract, a certain period of time for commercial gas trade will provide the previous natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers have detailed reservations about the rights and obligations of the natural gas dealer, system operator and users.
Rules lay down arrangements to enable customers to supply natural gas and terminate its supply, safeners, public dealer, system operator, user and gasified facility owner's rights and obligations in supply and use of natural gas; procedures for the supply and use of natural gas; procedures for the supply and use of natural gas; procedures for the supply of natural gas to connected customers; procedures to facilitate the supply of natural gas to connected customers.

The "Blue Belt" of the server manufacturer is a 33. 8% turnover last year.
A turnover of EUR 4.202 million last year was €4.202 million, which is 33. 8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - up to €904,7 thousand, according to Lursoft's annual report on Lursoft.
The company's management report says that in 2015, the company was working with the losses incurred for several reasons, including the continued lack of negotiable funds caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, leaving the credit line in force and leaving the 'Blue Card' with closed contracts without the possibility of complying with them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and to receive a rebate.
The Latvian market has also prevented the company from implementing the projects supported by the European Union Structural Funds, which would have allowed the production of new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
In the same way, the company's financial creators had a negative impact on the price rises in the price of raw materials and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"In the second half of July 2016, customers acknowledged price changes and were prepared to purchase goods for the new higher prices," said the company's leadership.
In 2015, the "Blue goat" started negotiations with potential investors, including the assessment of the movable and immovable assets of the company.
Investors have already been the largest creditor of the company Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have packaged and discussed potential investment plans.
At the same time, the operation and development of the company affected the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of the technological process, which allows for greater production of production and capacity.
"A number of installations were purchased which provide higher production speeds," said the company's leadership.
"Blue goat" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will enable the company to fulfil the orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since the intention protocols on the sale of the product have already been signed, the whole of the production will be sold in accordance with the intention protocols.
The new product will increase the turnover of around EUR 300 thousand per month, "said the management of the company.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
"In 2016, the first pilot container to Israel has extended the outlet to Cyprus and signed a cooperation agreement this year with a new supermarket chain in the US.
As a result of all these measures, the company intends to increase the turnover.
In 2014, "Blue goat" worked with €6.347 million and €5.113 million for losses.
"Blue goat" is founded in 1997 and has a core capital of €1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanovam (89, 11%) and Igor Shirshonam (10, 89%).

As a result of the renovation of the neighbour, the man is being squeezed and forced to leave their homes.
The LTV programme called Dmitry Saidjavic, a neighbour whose neighbour has collapsed in its apartment, and since then Dmitry from the caps and it is not certain that their stay is safe.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out an arbitrary construction and my apartment has been damaged.
Then I informed the Riga building board, the house manager and other organisations.
The Construction Board said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
"Habitats will have to go to the Latvian Civil Engineering Union and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry said.
The expert invited has arrived, marched the events and acknowledged that the coverage was unsatisfactory.
However, since the first construction of the Dmitry submits has passed a month, and no one was able to answer whether the location is not life-threatening.
The building was said: legislation is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they transferred to the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building board, and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
After all the paperwork of the paper, it is clear that construction works have been stopped, it can be heard that someone is working there.
In a further two months, there is an expert and the apartment holder who carries out the repairs, all these defects must be prevented.
The independent expert has drawn up its opinion, but the Executive Board shall consider it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal of metal present in this non-performing structure has not been affected, and it is not certain that the subcontractor is under threat.
"That is why we have asked for additional clarifications from this expert," Ilze Jukka said.
Despite the ban on any repairs to the upper apartment, it is still heard that construction continues.
The penalty for an arbitrary construction without a construction permit is between EUR 70 and 700, but in a given case the punishment may be much more severe.
As long as the opinion of the expert is expected, the construction board decided that the two apartments must not be exploited, both for construction works and the apartment of the Dmitry.
"This is a case in the case of a construction board, where in this way, citizens may not only pose a threat to their own property, but also to the owner of the subtitle, which has led to the ownership of the property of the subprime property, as a result of which the owner cannot exploit its property," the representative of the building board tells us.
It is now left to Dmitry to look for another place where to live - relatives, friends, hotels or other residences.
But Dmitry Dmitry may try to recover from a neighbouring civil legal basis, which can take a great deal of time.
Due to its arbitrary construction, both live in abnormal lives, until the civil engineering will give its conclusion and even three weeks to wait for even three weeks.
The damage will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
The owners of this apartment, because the construction board has not taken account of the fact that the construction board has not been taken into account, is also threatened by prison for up to six months.

NASA climate model: Venera has ever been a inhabitable planet
On the basis of the latest climate models of NASA, Venera has once been a inhabitable planet.
NASA scientists from the NASA Institute for Space Research have developed a model to explore the history of Venera using tools and algorithms, which are also used by climate scientists.
Modelis were designed to determine whether the Venice, which has a surface where there is no water and which the atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, in which the Earth has had similar conditions.
The scientists have said in advance that the slow pace of the Venice ceiling is explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venera was once a plan, a climate similar to the earth and has turned slowly.
The motto also looks at the earlier topography of Venera.
The planet has been more droughts than on the Earth, but they have had enough water and geographical diversity to be able to make life and prevent water evaporation.
In the early days of the Venera, Sun was 30 percent brighter.
The GISS model simulated in the Venice Model, the Venice Model model shows that the daily part of the day goes to it for 2 months, the press has been crushed by GISS scientists Antonijs Del Genio.
This process on the surface of the silent planet and leads to a case which, in turn, consists of the thickness of clothes acting as the umbrella, protecting the planet from the solar heat.
As a result, there is a moderate climate temperature, which is, in fact, a few degrees below the earth's earth today.
Modelis portrays the history of Venera, similar to the evolution theory that scientists have drawn up on their hypotheses.
Even though it has been inhabited for several billion years, Venera has been subject to too large a heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans evaporated the ultraviolet of ultraviolet radiation.
For the water, only the carbon dioxide atmosphere of the plan with a fatal greenhouse gas - Venera, which we know today.
Researchers published the results of the new Venera climate model for Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrik Roy resigned from Avalanche
On Thursday, the Avalanche's Avalanche and the Hockey Operator, Patrik Roy presented a request on the grounds of a lack of impact on the team decision-making process.

Workers of the North Sea oil platform are restarting negotiations and postponing strike
The work of the workers on the North Sea oil platform have been postponed because the two parties to the dispute have resumed the negotiations, the negotiators said.
Wood Group's Wood Group is taking action on the oil platforms of the Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
Over the coming weeks a number of full-day meetings which will start at the beginning of next week with the aim of reconsidering the problematic issues.
The trade unions said that their recent events, organised after more than 25 years, were targeted at a projected wage decline of 30 percent.
The Wood Group reduced the salaries for North Sea workers this year by 9 percent.
In 2014, the company reduced the wages of terrestrial workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional salary cuts would allow companies to survive the market recession.
Shell, Shell already reduced wages for a number of thousands of people and announced plans to put an end to the oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimise their work in the run-up to a large-scale merger with a British energy company AB Group BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is compounded by the British decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scotland's MEP David Anderson met with the workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole requires the economy of all of them, not individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest nearly $1.4 billion, compared to $7 billion in the last five years.
Keeping the fins of the Strait of Pledges in Pledges.
The latest Keynesian telescopa mission has helped astronoms to summarise the most complete catalogue of the stars of the stars of Pledges.
The new data help astronomers to understand why the stars of this stars turn in different speeds, as well as the way in which the asterisk ceiling applies to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that, compared to our results with the other stars, we will obtain more information about the link between the mass, the age and even the history of its solar system," Pasadenas Caltech Infrared and Analitic Centra known Luisa Rebula.
The starch of the Pledge is 445 Light from Earth's Earth.
Many stars of this stars are only beginning to rise, reaching around 125 million years.
They go through the maximum speed.
Coming with the maximum speed, the stars of this growing star emit a large number of stars.
In the case of stars in the magnetic field, they are putting a brake on the star.
With the ageing of the stars, their ceiling is decreasing.
Keplers measure the speed of each star, setting the time between the appearance of identifiable stars such as the solar planet.
The most recent turmoil turmoil shows that more stars go less than the smaller stars.
The bureau compares the stars with dejoints, more fruit debelts are making pirates less than small fertility debelts.
The bureau tells us that the Pletwt Pledge shows that cheap rocks are bigger and more exciting objects, while the faster rocks are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the stars of Pledge are so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where the characteristics of the stars can be compared with the ceiling.
The bureau tells us that the stars of Pledge help to develop theoretical models in both directions, both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the turbulence of the stars and the full stop process.
The Rebull and his colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the speed of the ceiling of the PCD in three new publications, which will shortly be published in Astronomian Journals.
