A 28-year-old shoe was found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old shooter was found in a hangle of a supermarket ladder who recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to beat his brother by saying that 'His life finally started to improve'.
The leader, who was found in front of the Westphalia supermarket on Wednesday, was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the Health Expert Office of the San Francisco Courts.
The San Francisco police said his death was a murder and an investigation is under way.
Luiss Galicia, an angry brother, told the San Francisco broadcaster ABC KGO that Frenk had previously worked as a pair in Boston, but six months ago he was working in his dream restaurant Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
Sons & Daughters from Restaurant said they were shocked and shocked by news of his death.
"We are a small team working as a cohesive family and we will miss him very much," he said.
In these difficult times, we think with the friends and family of Frank.
Luiss Galicia tells us he had died in the hostels at the beginning, but recently life has finally improved.
"He came into a new apartment and met a girl," Luiss told the radio station KGO.
Luiss Galicia says he does not know who would like to beat his younger brother.
He was a good man with a great deal of heart.
"He always congratulated his family, preparing a spiritual meal and preparing for dinner," said Luiss Galicia.
He never wanted to enter into a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"Taking into account everything that has gone wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond that died every day," he said.
Anyone with information about what happened is asked to call a SFPD hotline of 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: call for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade unions to launch protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Committee of New Doctors (JAK) is preparing to request the Council to support wider protests in early September.
The JAK believes that ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the LMA contract.
58% of the members voting voted against.
Eleven Mckorta, member of the JAK Council, said Thursday evening that the government remains silent on this issue and the proposal for the agreement has therefore been rejected.
She said, 'In view of this, the JAK vote has led to the total rejection of the offer of the treaty and to a decision to request new formal negotiations to discuss key issues'.
In response to the government's silence, the JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the drafting of new contracts, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS.
Following the vote rejecting LMA's proposed contract terms, as recommended by BMA, Dr Johan Malawana, a new doctor from LMA, resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary James Hants said the contract would be concluded with the British medics.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance excluded?
The splendid people who ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to round-up and declare an end to the eight months of war on terror and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greets with the Turkish leader in St Petersburg Palace, it gave the impression that Ankara needed more of this partnership.
However, they were crowned.
Vladimir Putin's smallest appeared frustrated and did not provoke warm emotions, even in view of his usual abstention.
By contrast, Erdogan called Putin at least five times his "dear friend," according to the meeting.
I felt the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
Next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was behaving as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm gives rise to conflicting feelings.
However, the irradiant message from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
On that occasion, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of inspiring a crowd in Moscow.
The abuse was even more painful given that it came from a friend's side.
Restoring genuine trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious allegations were that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil with the Islamic State controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied this.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place just because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a sort of victory.
The benefits of Ankara's peace settlement are obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to overthrow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which normally provides for the influx of millions of Russian tourists into Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian opportunists and charter companies will also be freed up when regular flights are restored.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the season.
As early as this week, state TV is predicting a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, as Turkish fruit and vegetables imports will be restored.
According to the local newspaper Vedemosti, 'tourists to them, tomatoes to us'.
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for their weak reaction to the coup attempt.
One could also note the dissatisfaction with the protracted negotiations on EU accession and Putin's intervention, which is happy to take advantage of Turkey's disconnection from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Please note that Moscow is well aware of this, because the fear of regime change in the country is deeply rooted itself.
The summit, which took place in this beautiful castle of the sea, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as some analyst called it, the 'excluded alliance', two countries that feel left out of the West join forces.
However, in spite of the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a vehicle for peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial talks without wishing to disclose information, both Presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President ambitiously avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes, when a NATO member killed a Russian battalion, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer have access to customers outside Scotland
The SKB will continue to play a supporting role in the future, said the bank's Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, the IRB will no longer be available.
Ross Macevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions, because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from St Petersburg to Vimblton tennis champion Endija Murey.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Wales, all the SKB references, outside the headquarters and the official exchange list, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Fewer private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank will now also gain attention.
He was interviewed during his trip with clients and staff on the Invernesshire.
He told the BBC Scottish channel: "The FSB will become the brand of our investors and with whom our staff work, because now we are more than a brand bank."
In the meantime, the bank itself became a global brand and the IRB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their sector and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
The SBA has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the "Six Nations" and will involve different brands in sponsorship of sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank because we have long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our clients?"
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we were to declare that we would be a great bank for our clients and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers rather than on our own needs, we have obviously made a major change.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frenkijs Detori wins 3000th in New Jersey with horse Predilection
The detors are scoring the champagne, winning their 3000th win twice in the first races in Newcastle.
Jokey Frank Detori won his 3000th victory in Britain's history on Friday, winning his first prize in New Hamilt.
He achieved this through his second win of the race, which took place in his home city, with Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, which has reached the stage of horse races.
He has joined Seram Gordon Ričardsam, Dougam Smitam, Leicester Pigota, Peter Edery and Villius Karsons.
"This is something special," said the auxiliary champion Jokey Datori, who first won the horse Ghayar.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this happened in New marketing, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not Royal Askota, but an ordinary Friday with 20 000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are expected with applause and tastes.
The two Jockeys have reached the record at the time of the season, with world champion Richard Johnson and the 20-time champion Sir Anthony Makkow, who has played several record games in his career, winning over 4300 wins.
Lesters Pigots won a 493 win over the career.
Frenkijs is one of the best fences of our time, and it is no surprise that he has achieved something that only a rare one can achieve.
He is strong and strong, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racist spokesman, his enthusiasm and his charisma attracts fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, in the Epsoma race, I said to French that he would have won 6 000 if he had not participated only at the weekend and in the big race.
In serious terms, however, it is a real pleasure that Frenky has been winning the British race on a regular basis for 30 years.
He is a lifetime that fits perfectly well in the British race, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frenks Detori celebrated this achievement with his trade mark, a flying landing.
From finishing-wind speed to flying slope, Frenky Detori has been a British horse racing face for 20 years.
This has been an adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous' Grand Seventh Farmers' of 1996 in Scots, and has survived a plane crash and a ban on the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was hard to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his character, challenging those who questioned him when he came back to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detors have said in advance that they would like to continue at least 50 years of the race.
Russian President Putin dismisses Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the closest circle of Putin for many years.
The 63 year old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of head of the Russian presidential administration," without giving any reason.
Antons Vaino, who has been deputy since 2012, has been appointed to replace Mr Ivanova.
The 44-year-old Waino has had a diplomat.
The landscape was born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, promising prestigious to the Moscow National Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and subsequently worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later led the presidential protocol and the administration of government officials.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: 'Thank you for your confidence'.
In my opinion, the primary role of the administration is to support your work as President of the Republic in drawing up laws and controlling the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin told Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov wanted to leave his job and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Is the smiles persuaded?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and worked in the Soviet security service, like Putin.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a meeting broadcast on state television, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But in spite of all the smiles, rarely this explanation is convincing, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of a power struggle?
No one knows that.
However, the official statement that the man who was supposed to be a potential president suddenly wanted to be the head of Russian environmental policy is perceived with great scepticism.
Ivanov says to Putin in the notes published on the Kremlin's website: 'It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 you ask me to entrust this difficult position, possibly even to say problematic position, four years.
It turns out that I have been in office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He has previously been Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's State Security Service, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor of the KGB, Ivanov held his deputy position.
When Putin came to power, he said Ivanov was among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of his second term, Ivanov was considered a potential presidential candidate in Russia, as Putin's re-election to the third term would be unconstitutional.
At that time, however, he became another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and he returned to office after three and a half years.
The appearance of grass fish in a garden in Banfu
One husband from Banfa is asking for help to clarify the conditions in which fish of his species appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sand sands who have left a watertight.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres from the sea, released a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimetres of large fish were caught in his garden.
Cross of wine-growing: the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
Currently, 1.35 billion pound projects are expected to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the crowd and the viadukt of the Queensland, which means that the bridge has now been connected to Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the building of the bridge is coming to an end.
The construction of the fifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 aid cables.
Currently, the 1.35 billion pound projects are expected to be completed in May 2017.
Economic secretary Ket Brawn was today in the building place and was one of the first to go down the bridge.
He said: 'This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Wine-ferry Bridge'.
In this project, we see an incredible civil engineering solution, with more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel being used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, bridging and viaduclear are an extremely delicate process that requires huge precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the last link between the bridge and Rositu will be lifted today, meaning that all parts of the bridge are ready to be put in.
Maikls Martins, director of the fourth bridge project: "The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link is a demonstration of the construction of top-class engineering.
After installing the last road section and connecting it to the northern tower, we were forced to connect the northern road to the ground part or viadke.
This was done by putting a viaduukta of 700 millimetres on the northern border.
It was a huge operation and, at the same time, a very delicate one.
It is immense because the viaduclear is 222 metres long, weighing around 6 000 tonnes and had to drain a line of about 3%.
The delicate, because the allowance in both directions worked by the team was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything managed well.
Simona Bailsa is winning gold exercise for women.
Pressure has been lost.
It is a matter of anxiety.
It is not all worrying in the case of Simmons Bail.
Dynamic slowdown.
Efforts are carried out on a beam without effort.
Insurmountable on the floor.
Absolutely not.
Finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, an American gymnastics won the golden medal, showing the difference between ourselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total of points was 62.198 head courts above the silver medal and her team-mate and bronze medal winner of the Russian athlete Alian Mustafina.
On Thursday, US? athlete Simona Bailsa took a vigour on the beam's individual multicultural champion of women at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row to win the multi-champion title and the fifth best player, slowly strengthening the reputation as the best player of his generation and perhaps the best player in history.
When the end result was announced, she came out in tears because the long road was over.
This achievement puts him next to unparalleled athletes such as Michael Felps, who raised his sport at another level.
Bail has dominated his sport for the past three years, gaining 15 medals in world championships, including 10 golden medals, fulfilling such excellent, precise and ambitious combinations of exercise that the 1984 Olympic championship, Mary Lu Retone, called him the "best exercise she ever saw."
In Brazil she was awaited by the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes placed on her, not with other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Springa, Texas without gold medals.
Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane (left) are on the eve of their respective gold and silver medals in their sports championship in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailsa won the first golden medal on Tuesday, making a special shortlist of Martas Karolji's winner.
Although Bail claims that in his long journey to the top of the noble, it had not expected anything, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which includes her special acrobic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that fits perfectly well on the street next to the Rio Olympics.
It is no coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered on a sports trip by a third ney mother in Eimia, where the Barmane terni was taking place, has now become a force to be counted.
She has not lost in the race since summer 2013 and the playwright can continue for as long as Baysa wants it.
Although Mustafina took a little lead in two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The parity beam and the free movement - the part of the race, where Bailsa will defend his championship, are still in front of us.
She led the way with 15,433 on the beam and strengthened the lead at 15.933 free movements.
Raismane swept her cheerfully while they were expecting results that were only formality and that she came out in the tears when the dream she once wrote in her book of remembrance came true.
Raismane's result was a small reprisal for four years when she divided third with Mustafinu but lost her fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old cemetery, which the Americans call 'grandmother', came under a convincing leadership.
After her performance in the free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate her to the air smoke crowd.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bail's top Twitter record, which she published this week, is now playing a completely different role.
The 6-year-old Mahaja Brauns has been fired in Philadelphia.
Police said the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, saying it was the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The grandparents of CBS Philadelphia have confirmed to the news channel that it is Mahaja Brauns.
Parents say that Brauns was shot several times, including in the compartment, in the foot, in his arm and in his arm, but there was still consciousness when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Deloresa Melendeza's story on television: 'His little body was simply a bully crowd.'
I could not believe that.
A lae in a critical condition has been hospitalised and has already undergone several operations.
The family is telling us that he will certainly recover.
He had to start his first class at local primary school.
Brasilia is one of four people shot dead in the town of Jerusalem.
Three men were also shot: two 29 year old men and one 32 year old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one men aged 29 is in a critical situation, while the other two victims are in a stable situation.
The canal says that the child was found in the front seat of the machinery in the vicinity of the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely to be involved in the shooting.
A weapon's cartridge, which belongs to a variety of weapons, is located at the site of the event.
It seems to have been a long-standing shooting.
Sachulides were found on both sides of the pedestrian cabinet.
"It seems that there have been several armed shooters who actively participated in the shooting," said Anthony Ginaldi, the police chief of Philadelphia.
Several homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has yet been detained and reports that surveillance cameras have been checked by the police.
A 6-year-old girl was hit by the window during her shooting on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the district of Vestouklein.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simona, Gabia and Lauria?
I call it the 2008 Women's Olympic Truce, Lenlatant Komandu, for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three millionaires, Simona Bailsa, Gabia Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, who inspire many girls of new origin.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, a Jewish and Medisona Kociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best exercise has been an American of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabia ranked 1-2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Duglasa became the Olympic champion surprisingly, and America was able to swallow.
Now the world has seen the incredible exercise of three world championships, Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, with unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win the golden medal in an individual multi-ethnic struggle for women.
Her team, Alija Raismane, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different at the hours of exercise.
Simona, Gabia and Lauria entered the Olympics in the same way as Alija and Medison.
They are the Olympic Partners, because the next Olympic exercise will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year of the third year of work in Marta Karola.
As a matter of fact, exercise is expensive sport, teachers are mainly trained in private light lattics clubs, and they are held by parents who pay for training, premises, travel, formations, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightline clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes are spending all their training, and this is a costly and long-lasting investment for soft families.
Eimia Burias - Simone Bayonce's and Megija Hainy - have trained their athletes since the two girls started to take an easy time.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabia and Lauria with cheaper exercises.
I founded my lightweight organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is based in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 city's young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercise exercises free of charge or at low cost, and we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a subsidiary in Detroit (my home city) to give local young people the opportunity to get to know this excellent sport.
Laughter develops coordination of forces, lots and bodies, and teaches hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in light Latin and it is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simona, Alija, Gabia and Medison for the excellent demonstration of "Girl Priska," in acquiring gold medals of the Olympic Games and in motivating countless young girls of different origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
The new doctors plan to take more strike action following the rejection of the proposal by James Hanta.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by agreeing to a change to the agreement with the British Medical Association representatives, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hants announced plans to conclude a contract, saying that NHS is in a precarious position and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions for night work and at weekends to improve working conditions in non-standard hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr Elēna Makourta, the spokesman for the new physicians in BMA, said that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will aggravate the labour crisis and it does not impose equal conditions on all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors sign the new treaty, so progress needs to be made, because there is not much time left.
The efforts of BMA to solve the problem through negotiation have come up against a lack of willingness on the part of the government, and sometimes with complete silence.
This is in spite of the fact that until last month James Hants said that his door was always open.
Jessir Hanth must act immediately, stop inaction and work with young doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
Over the last strike at the end of April, more than 13 000 routine operations and 100 000 visits were postponed, while nurses and advisers tried to replace doctors who had gone into a haddock.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by agreeing to a change to the agreement with the British Medical Association representatives.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work at weekends for 54 000 new doctors covered by the new treaties.
The CEO of NHS employment, Daniels Mortimers, called on young doctors not to strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on burdened workers and worries, create stress and obstacles for patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been talking to the new doctor committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about the guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of workers, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay inequality in medicine - shows that employers, the health education authorities of England and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products can reduce the risk of heart by 2 pounds a day.
Thousands of patients with a heart could be treated with 2 pounds a day because the official recommends that they should be used for more people and for a longer period.
Counterfeiting medicines Ticagrelor reduce the risk of repetition of heart attacks for people with heart limits.
This drug is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of repetition.
NHS recommends using the preparation for 4 years at heart to further reduce the risk of heart attack for people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE, currently responsible for NHS, recommends using the preparation for 4 years after heart to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Every year, some 140 000 people in England experience heart attacks and a quarter of them experience a repetition of heart or stroke.
Cardistrian and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in heart walls and the formation of dams.
If the dam bursts to burst, it can create a thrombin, block the flow of blood to the heart and cause a heart.
On the other hand, if the thrombin is cut off from a blood-wall, it can get on to the bloodshed and block blood access to the brain, causing the plot.
The people who have had a heart are at greater risk of repetition.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name of Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombs developing.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and a further 3 years for 60 mg a day, together with an aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longson, Director of Health Technologies, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent a repetitive heart, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart, experience another heart or stroke, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attacks may have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of repetition of heart attacks and infarcts for people who have once experienced it.
Provisibly recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment options to the thousands of people who have benefited from it.
In view of the limited information on Ticagrelor's efficacy and safety, in particular the risk of bloodiness for the use of this drug for more than three years, the draft guidelines shall not recommend its use beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness contributes to electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurs Rahmans, the former mayor of the Tauerhamlet, was dismissed as a result of corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pikls criticizes police, election monitors and city councils that they ignore signs of electoral fraud because they "fear to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former communal secretary, who has now become head of an anti-corruption organisation, says that voter intimidation on religious grounds is so prevalent that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at the election stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should produce an identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters have to give only the name and address.
He went on to say that "we have to make sure that we do not have a double voting system."
The rapporteurs also need more protection, says Sir Eric.
He considers that the press should ensure greater access to Board documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it'.
The report was commissioned after the scandal in connection with the elections to the town of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, a special electoral court decided to remove Lutfuru Rahman from his position as mayor of the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 'cynically distorted' the religious perception of his Muslim community and silenced his critics on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign by stating that it is the religious duty of religious believers to vote for him."
Approximately 300 votes were falsified or dubious because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also indicates signs of fraud throughout the country.
He said that it was particularly worrying to see postal fraud, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their favourite candidates.
Sir Eriks suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to establish a person's identity.
The report says that "evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for senior community candidates, especially in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities."
"There is a fear that regional authorities will not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be touched."
Sir Eric set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on mail order voting by political activists to prevent the "casting of votes."
The report before Theresa May also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists to fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to produce an identity document before the vote.
Address the purchase by the voters who cast their votes with a special ink in order to avoid double voting.
Systematic checks on the nationality of persons to verify that the person has the right to vote.
Introduce a three year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
It has been denied to political campaigners and activists the work of votes cast by post and electoral envelopes to vote by post.
Ensure police authority to appoint guards at polling stations.
Changes to the law to make it easier to hold persons liable for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
There is a ban on photographing at the polling stations.
To require only English at polling stations (except for Wales).
Increasing training to ensure that voters go to the polling boxes one day.
Sir Eric is strongly critical of the Metropolitan police, who failed to understand that no charges have been brought against the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The Court of Elections only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for acts of corruption and fraud."
He was strongly found guilty of criminal evidence by standard criminal evidence based on compelling evidence.
He also criticized the inefficient scrutiny of the city's voters at the polling stations.
Sir Erich said: "The court decision last year is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the homeland of parliament, but the worrying and disguised spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of institutions that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.
Running of cyclists - Keep Park and other Rio Olympic accomplices
The 2016 Rio Olympics fans enthusiastically welcomed French cyclone Paulin Ferrandu Prevotu, who fans have found to be very similar to Cambridge's hercogiet.
However, a 24-year-old cyclone is not the only athlete who is fighting this summer for gold who, as media writes, is proud of his famous counterpart.
For this reason, on the occasion of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that we are now seeing on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of participants in the Olympic Games, which is quite similar to the Hollywood star.
Municipal and village: Breidijs Elon, a US-led pile team, left with Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood.
Apart from the Keep-witness on the wheeled road trap, many people on the Internet say that this lospy could be the father of the superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio's twin brother.
Men's shootout team member Breidy Elon set a storm on Twitter when photographs were published, where he was very close to Wall Street Wilk.
The athlete also noticed a storm in social media and admitted that he was compared with Leonardo Di Caprio since his childhood.
"I personally do not see a great deal of similarities except a barrel," Breidby told Huffington Post.
"He's a good girl, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular cohorts of the London 2012 Olympics will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the striking similarity between Gregu Rotterdam and the popular actor Nile Patrik Harare, a staggering British far-sighted alliance.
The Russian millionaire Alija Mustafina is comparing, thanks to its great, fierce eyes, to American singer Glorya Estefanu, who is of Cubans' origin.
In terms of swimming, South African swimming spokesman Kamerons van der Burgs has been comparing for several years with the Creative Star star Metw Morison.

Likewise, ancient accomplices include a tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet, who have similar eyes and lips.
Russian silver daughter Julian Efimov and actress Annalina Mccord can be proud not only of his sunny skin and blond mats, while fans say the athlete American athlete Nine Adrian is like Jose Gordon Levitam.
Houpai Solo and Deksters Actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar facial form and eyes.
No one: one user on Twitter was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also saw these similarities.
Theory: this user believes that there is probably a reason why both seem to be so similar
A recent Twitter user was very pleased to say that "other internet users agree that Houpa Solo and Jenifer Karpentere are in fact identical."
There is indeed a very similar face form and eyes to the US football star and the Serbian "Deksters" actress.
Other popular comparisons relate to Kerry Walk Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the Laurg Linnia, as well as the gold medallist Gaby Duglasa is proud of a beautiful, widespread smile like Bring It On.
The comments made by the CBC Olympics apologise for their comment that the Chinese bather was "closed as a pig."
Analysis by Bairona Makdonalda of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas in fourth place in the finishing 4x200 m free style feet for women sparked a storm of indignation on the CBC viewers.
The Canadian CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese grey was "out of the race to smell" and "finished as a pig."
Commissioner Bairons McCann thought his microphone had been switched off when 4x200 m free-style festival for women at the end of the season set out their personal views.
Makdonalds, who was included in the CBC's team of commentators to give their comments live, said: "This small fourteenth Chinese is unable to keep up with them."
"She went too far and went out of the race that it was only ridiculing and ended as a pig."
Thank you very much.
Ai Yanhana, a 14-year-old Chinese grey man in the second phase, was 1: 57.79, 1.61 seconds more than the result of Teilores Rucka, which allowed the canteens to catch up with China.
The audiences throughout Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tons and expressions.
Emet Makfarlain wrote Twitter: "Have the CBC's direct commentator just said that a 14-year-old Chinese bay" ended like a pig?? "
It was wrong to understand that they were still in the hat.
Ai Yanha of China's 4x200m free style finalists for women were named 'a young fourteenth Chinese man who does not keep up'.
Critics against Bairona McDonalda came into force quickly, as many asked for clarification.
Twitter users were unable to believe by hearing the insensitive comments made by Bairona Makdonalda.
Twitter user Sara Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
Because of the CBC and Canada, and you, we all sound like a racist. #opio.
Soon then, Scottish Rice, who then led the CBC live broadcaster, apologised for the comments made by Makdonalda, saying: "We apologise that the comment about the swimming result was snatched in the direct ether."
It was a failed choice of words and we regret that.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded to Twitter.
Makdonalda's colleague, Scottish Racela, had to apologise for his place.
Then the CBC made apologies to over 90 Twitter users who complained about Makdonalda's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that the following comments were made and that they came to the direct edition.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologised to all viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairona's comments were made about the bathers' performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were, in any case, unprofessional and unsuccessful expressions and Bairons deplore what has happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonalds personally apologised in the hemicycle and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
"I would like to use a moment and apologise for the comment I made yesterday following free women's competitions," he said.
I am talking about the bathers' performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect, and I am very sorry indeed that was the case.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who is shamelessly encountering in the middle of a supermarket.
The shoppers were uncomfortable when a woman started to dress to be in the middle of a shop for a time bomb.
She went on to aggravate the situation to make sure that they were standing up and then dragged down by putting the bombs back on the shelf.
She continued her search for clothes in the Folkestonas Bouverie Place shopping centre shop and then went on to four more bicks.
Primark stores in the Bouverie Place in the Folkeston, a place where her underground arrived and then put it back on her shelf.
There were two children's mother Jenny Davidson in the shop at the time, who said that the unknown woman took her clothes and left the shop after the underway, but did not get away with anything.
She points out that people were unable to believe in their own eyes.
In the middle of the shop she took off the shelf, pulled her herring and troubles and shooted them on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to gauge them, she simply congregated them on the spot.
Everyone looked at her fingers down and obviously the woman did not like them because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She shook three more beacons until she decided that she did not like any of them and left the shop.
It did not seem that she would be worried that somebody would look or think about a man who would buy the clothes she is going to take.
Davidson Jayoudze (33 years) from Kenya said: "It is a Deraa idea that someone will buy clothes that have spared another person and have not subsequently been cleared."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson Juncker adds: "I suppose that, after her departure, the shop workers removed these clothes from the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that a new subwind could be bought and that another woman would know that they were forever and then they were not washed.
Primark pointed out that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
Protecting themselves from firearms through Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in the close distance from the attackers with the firearm, we spoke to Krav Maga's master-master from New York Rona Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win over the aggressor.
The amusement indicates that if the attacker is attacked from the back, then the first step must be to clearly see the aggressor and avoid a shot trajectory.
Then the weapon must be shouted between its predecessor and shoulder and a blow in the face of its free elcons.
Then there is a knock-on knee in the circuit and while the aggressor is in the knee, he has to withdraw his weapon, put his arm on his face and step down and continue to turn the weapon against him.
If the aggressor is approaching, the situation is similar: sham trajectory must be avoided, a weapon must be shut down and it must be so that the evil cannot be fired.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the gun and the act must be carried out by the hair, and must finally withdraw his weapon and continue to be portrayed on him.
It sounds difficult?
Watch a video to see exactly what Mizraki is doing.
But remember if you are not the master of Krav Maga, it is safer to give the robber your money.
The family of the men demolishes the social house of Saltah Kornvolas and is being put on the streets.
The family of the chambers has been evicted from their place of residence for terrorising their neighbours, causing damage to the social house to the tune of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Šon Trebilkok, were sidelined from their property in Saltah, Korngar, because a number of complaints have been lodged with them.
When they were forcibly evicted from property, the shocking housing spokespersons found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the walls and in the walls, the waste was out everywhere and the walls were filled with graffiti.
The family has now been laid off from property and is most likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, the operator of Cornvolas Housing, says there are fears that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She tells us that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like that.
A number of factors need to be considered in this case, as this property will no longer have a good reputation in the future in Cornwel.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who have been in misery periodically, and the police say that their terror manifested itself in violence, beismic grooming, bullying of the local population, drug use, drug sales and beautiful bleeding and laughing.
The 44-year-old Skeldonei, on whom he was named, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
A number of dehydrated home rooms found waste.
There are also several floors in the home where drugs can be traded in the past.
Neighbours say that they have been on the streets regularly and are constantly called police.
They were forcibly disposed of by the Kornvolas Housing Service when they were given 11 weeks to get rid of their homes on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbours were very happy to evict because their life was absolutely hell.
One said: 'They did not care for other citizens'.
We lived side by side for 20 years; it has always been crazy.
Incredibly how often we have seen the police here.
We could not sleep this morning.
We wake up because there was such silence - we are not used to that!
Now that they are finally leaving, it will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatriks, the head of the Cornvola Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police have been regularly called here.
The houses of the August garden found various old and unworkable objects.
He also said: 'It is a great pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because evictions are always the last step to be considered by the Housing Service of Kornvolas'.
This was a very complex case, because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbours were very difficult to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the efforts made by my entire team, the police and members of Devon and Kornvola, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make the lives of our neighbours easier and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatriks said that all three sons were living here during different periods of time, but everyone was around 20 years old.
A dirty hair left on the floor in one of the rooms after being evicted.
The staff of the service will now have to clean up the waste-house that is left behind.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, scales, accessories and 1 700 cash pounds.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of conserving Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Le Scheldona, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being evicted, they are now renting a private property in Plyuta.
There were graffiti on many of the walls of the house.
Police say they will continue to put out the tenants who violate their rental agreements.
The eviction is an unequivocal warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said that: 'This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and will have no consequences'.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour is unacceptable to the Devon and Kronvola police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The readiness to spend can give a boost to the economy.
The Akropolis LT, which manages the Akropolis shopping and recreational centres in Vilnius, Klaippend and Schaulis, will be merged with the Akropolis Group, inheriting all the commitments made so far against Akropolis LT partners and workers.
The aim of the combination of Akropolis LT and the Akropolis Group is to be implemented by 1 October this year.

"The new company structure will make more effective use of Akropolis LT's teamwork and competences in successfully developing the projects and taking the necessary decisions quickly," said Saulė Zabulionytė, a member of the board of the Akropolis Group.
The Akropolis Group is a group of companies that manage property development, leasing and management companies in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria.

The Cannes mayor banned the burkini swimmings on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern southern resort city of Cannes has banned the burkini swimming collar in the city's beaches, which almost completely covers the woman's body and very much resembles hydrochotte, local officials said Thursday.
Cannes Mayor David Linar has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing water that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"A poub chat that grandly illustrates religious affiliations at a time when France and places of worship are the targets of terrorist attacks can pose a risk to public order disturbances (bitter, collision, etc.) that need to be prevented," the order said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outspoken clothing, which is about trust in terrorist movements that are waging war with us," said Tiere Miguel, the head of the municipal utilities.
He added that the burkini swimmers on the beaches of Cannes had not been seen since July 28, when Linars, a right-wing Republican member, signed the order and entered into force.
This week, an acvince in Marseille cancelled a private event for Muslim women who would wear a burkha in swimming collar, as it was outraged by politicians from both the right and the left.
In France, it is forbidden to wear the headscarves of Muslim women, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are banned.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby resort city of Nice, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.
On 26 July, two attackers who had shattered their faith in the Islamic State were brutally murdered in a priest in a church in north-west France.

The "Cuba" festival began in Lucavsala.
At the evening of Thursday 11 August, Lucavsala was given one of the last festivals this summer - Cuba will be held there until Sunday night.
The first evening of this year, groups like Enter Shikari from Great Britain, expected last year but missing from the programme, NOFX, DJ Maxim from The Prodigy and others.
In the next few days of the festival, the program also contains noteworthy words: Guano Apes and Garbage, the bunker of Ramones, Marky Ramon, with Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, Brutto & Lyapis, the Belarusian leader at the top of Sergei Mihaloku, the popular grim and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainians Vopli Vidoplyasova and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year in which the Kubana festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but the organisers were not prevented from trying again: they added the label to the name, the programme also included a Latvian group (on Friday night 19: 15 on the stage up to the All Day Long) and said the festival had now become "closer to and gained the local flask beside the symbols of Riga such as its panorama and castles."
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is still too early to judge, because the festival was only on its sights, but, as Delfi Izklaide observed the first night, at least for the time being huge crowds of people have not been attracted and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British Track Driving Team is twice as good as the Olympic record and winning in a row.
The British trainer on Thursday doubled the Olympic record and won a row for men.
The first round of the Olympic record was corrected by the British, but the first round of the competition was redesigned by young boys.
The British team, with New Zealand, took off the New Zealand's Olympic record holders, leaving them with silver medals.
The British team won 42.440 seconds in the final, with young boys beating 0.102 seconds.
The French team beat Australia in the fight for a bronze.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of a women's stay: the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4: 13.260.
The President, who remained in the shadows: Gustavo Zemgale, 145.
Friday 12 August marks the 14th anniversary of the birth of Latvian President Gustav Zemgals.
The country was proclaimed by the Zemgale, but unearned was left in the shadow of the last president of Latvia, John Chakste, and the last president of the pre-war period, Karille Ulman.
None of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgale, and Arnolds Auzins writes in a book on Gustave Zemgale a decade ago.
Earth is one of the few high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humour, said Delfi Auzins.
Others are stubbornly, always very right.
He taught that not, today it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was close to the people," he said.
Modern politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Carli Ulman as a good leader, but rarely know how bad he was.
General Balodis was the only person to whom he has not been blamed in government meetings.
Even if he is kind and smile in the bills, he was hysterical by nature.
"The earth is giving the opposite impression with its sense of humour and democracy," said Auzins.
Aivars Stranga, Professor of History and Faculty of philosophy at the University of Latvia, agrees with Mr Auziņa's assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and balanced statesman.
He also notes that Zemgale has highlighted respect for minorities and has regularly called on Jewish representatives to the presidential Palace.
"At the time it was not business as usual, Alberts Kviesis took over the tradition after the Home Presidency," said the historian.
He was such a silent and balanced man who had to be President for a long time.
He did not seek it himself; he simply did not wear praise.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French, but considered that the President should certainly understand it.
"During the presidency, the French foundation was taught," Stranga said.
The ground did not allow him to stand again, he did not like it to be really high.
In every respect, he is a very dignified figure in Latvia's history and was in a serious position before he came to the presidential Palace - he was a very demanding notary.
Zemgale was also the most famous Zemgale treasury Suvorova in the Street 3, where there was a giant and colourful organization, with the Latvian state negotiating practically.
He was always open-minded.
It was not a great fan of Ulman, but he did not mind publicly.
"In private conversations, he has sometimes said that Ulman's actions are not sympathetic to him," Stranga said.
There was a life of peace, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How does the Earth remember today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he is only associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were central.
"During his time there were no major shocks, he might be associated with such a real stable presidency," summed up by Stranga.
Gustava was also on a visit to Sweden during his country's Presidency from 1927 to 1930, which implied full recognition in his neighbour country and inclusion in the northern European family of democratic nations.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgale arrived on a visit to Stockholm.
A reply visit by Swedish King Gustava V to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871 and was forever in January 1939.
Simply ways of helping a child to cope with anger slowdown.
I often have to deal with the anger of the child, the appearance of anxiety by parents, being seen as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly displays his anger, we do not know how to react, Econet says psychoe Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist is encouraging a small negotiation on these natural and human feelings - anger and anxiety that everyone is experiencing periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person and it usually comes up when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, alarmed - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can have our anger and angry in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep on ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can stir the odd, absorb cigarettes - that is not the best way to dispel anger!), go down the table and do other things that we do not normally do.
We are not taking our aggression against others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children when they find anger do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, 'j away!', you're a fool ',' Bad mamma ',' I do not see you ',' I'll be unfriendly with you '- and very rarely when you can say' I am angry at you '.
Children live in literal terms, they are entirely here at this point in time, they are spontaneous and truly present their feelings, and are also often held hostage by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prohibit a child from displaying feelings, including anger, that they do not shame and do not care about it, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Does relations need to be upheld?
A long working day, in which things have not gone quite as you would like, or simply a bad feeling, is so many reasons why I would like to pick up for a moment, a day or even longer from the whole world.
Is it possible to read the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Or does this show that each partner has its own way to go?
We are divided by gentlemen in different ages.
Janis (23) is brief and concise: 'In my view, if you need a pause in your relationship, you are not with the right person'.
In the meantime, Eduards (30) has unveiled a scheme which is likely to help anyone.
If you feel that a partner begins to fall on you for every small detail, then surely that is the time when you should study other hunting fields to see whether you are missing or whether you in particular do not think about him or not want to see him anymore.
So the answer is, yes, withholding the badge can help save time and understand how important you are to have the other half way.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, the relationship must be held on a daily basis, because if accompanied by 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I see every detail that the other does, and it starts to fall on nerves.
People are beginning to distract each other, especially when it is not even more about what to talk about, just what you have done in the day.
My personal experience leads me to think so, so I have not lived the relationship for more than a couple of months either.
If you think for a moment that it is better elsewhere or at others, then why does this woman, with whom you are with, deserve one who can think that there are not good enough fields here and there are fields of paradise behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is already a little treason.
If not, there is no.
"I have it, so I am a little fine for those who do not."
The code (33) has almost the opposite view.
It seems to me that everyone needs a moment for some breathing space.
You could not watch each minute, all the time, from the morning to the night in the eyes of each other and swimming for the love of the love.
I am sorry.
There are so many things - friends, jobs, blankets.
Everything has its time.
Of course, a friend or a wife, but if both are able to keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live to the edge of the grave.
That is what it is all about.
Martin (27) said: 'It is hard to say, need or should not take a pause, but one thing is clear: its initiator does not have anything to the end, something is missing'.
If this is the case, it must be taken into account that there will be some change in the short term - on the right or on the bad side - and it depends on itself.
I think that while there is a new and a crack, it is necessary - at all times, but when everything remains serious and when relations go into a completely different phase, then there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you cannot take each other's society right now and need breathing once and for all, then what will happen when you are pensioners who comment on how the herring is throwing or arguing about where the horse should be raised better on the day," said Kristaps (19).
All the words of the gentleman have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality Rozental first aroused the interest of the Latvians in patented arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvians, who will remain as such unforgettable," Roman Suta wrote at the time of the Latvian grandmaster of the gift, Jani Rozental.
It is also clear that Rozental is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August and has been available for visitors since 13 August and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Art Museum, with extensive retrospection, celebrates Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose 50th birthday at international level is included in the UNESCO Day calendar.
The downhill exhibition, which covers more than 150 works, is one of the main events of the annual YEI.
The arts' selection is largely based on the Latvian National Art Museum, which convincingly represents the main stages of the creative activity of the classicle and the variety of genes, stylistic variations and techniques.
In addition, screenings from Akseli Gallena-Kallela museum, article and museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukuma museum and a number of private collections in Latvia and Finland are being used.
The centenary atmosphere is revived by the presence of photographs, the exhibition mobile application reveals the concoctions of certain works of art with photographs received by the painting brigade for the benefit of his own photograph.
In the Latvian National Art Museum, Rozentāls-seura, the Latvian Friendship Association, which is named after Latvian classical museum, is at the same time offering the first stop of a small information exhibition with a sight in Finland, with the hearts in Latvia.
A similar screen with a description of the content in English, Finnish and Swedish languages will be opened in the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki in the autumn.
Met Leblank is eager to return to the show TopGear.
Mets Leblank, head of TopGear Television's TopGear, said he was looking forward to returning to the second season of the car show but said he did not know what is expected in the future.
So far, nothing is officially happening.
"If so, the BBC will announce it," Leblank said in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about the future of 'Asia in the floor' arose in July, when the survivor of Leblanca, Chris Ashton, announced that he would withdraw from the programme.
Evans admitted after leaving Leblank and "Gas in the floor" were "created for each other."
Evance describes the stars as a "real and good man," thereby dispelling rumours that the friendship of the two has broken down during the filming period.
When asked Leblankm what he liked most this winter, he said that travelling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reported that the show did not yet plan to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

Two cyclists were taken to hospital in Sigulda after the collision.
In Sigulda, two cyclists hit the Swiss Street with various injuries, the state police said.
Men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were taken to medical facilities, were involved in the accident.
The bicycle was also hit in the coke.
In 1989, a man was born in the streets of 1905 and handed over to medical care.
In Dobele, in the park of Naudine, a motorcyclists born in 1989 were born to avoid a dog that was washed on the road and overturned.
He is also in hospital.
The Latvian authorities registered 71 road traffic accidents with 16 victims last night.
In some places it will fall and it will become cool.
Some rainfall is expected in Latvia on Friday too and it will become another degree, LETA was told at the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Center.
Places may be duplicated in the custom.
The rain is expected to dominate in Kurzeme and the north of Vidzeme.
The maximum temperature will be limited to + 16, + 19 degrees.
The day will go unravelled and the sun will dominate.
However, air will not be warmer than + 18 degrees.
The business scenes of the US model in his interpretation have won a perverse glane of a full-blown photographic session and the inability of a tough-screen film.

The Islamic State has captured 2 000 civilians in Syria.
Around 2,000 civilians used as human shields have been held hostage by Islamic State militants fleeing Menbij, Syria's Aleppo province, an observer and Kurdish alliance said Friday.
"We did not shoot them because they took the civilian population along with them when they flee to Jerusalem," a spokesman for the Kurd Menbij military council said.
Syria's Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish Arab alliance in northern Syria, said Friday that Menbica was released from jihadists.
The Islamic State, Menbij, was invaded in 2014.
QSD evicted most Islamic State fighters from Menbij last week, but some resisted and fiercely resisted.
However, on Friday they left the city to take their prisoners with them.
The Islamist are heading to Jerusalem, which is at the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that around 2,000 people had been kidnapped by Islamic State.
SOHR reported that Islamist vehicles had been kidnapped by the city, forced to disembark and then taken to Jerusalem.
Islamic State militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamist kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, from the territory of Deir ez Zora in eastern Syria.
Afterwards, the Islamists released some 270 of the prisoners.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled Menbij is unknown.
QSD managed to save 2 500 people held hostage by Islamist Menbij, a spokesman for the Kurdish military council reported.
According to the SOHR, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the battle against Manbija.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists have been killed.
Kolegova refuses to apply for the position of head of the Revenue Service.
State Environmental Service chief Inga Kolegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the State Revenue Service's Director-General, LETA was informed by the Finance Ministry.
Colleagues said her candidacy had increased tensions between the ruling coalition parties.
The real reasons for the discussion seem to be the obvious but, more often, the blind interest of politicians and have nothing to do with assessing my professional abilities.
"That's not acceptable to me," he said.
If her candidacy were approved by the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow her to work and make the necessary changes to the Revenue Service fully operational, with the support of the whole government.
Without this, full work would not be possible, says Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment the whole process of my candidacy is too politicised," the official said.
"Thank you for the trust and support that I have shown, this is a experience that I value as a benefit," he wrote to Reizniece-Ozka Kolegova in his application.
Unity said Wednesday that the meeting with Kolegova revealed a "major discrepancy" between the nominee's explanations and the information available in the public registers on the cost of the dividends, as the decisions made by the meeting of the public participants at the Pallogue meeting foresaw no profit.
Currently, the Revenue Service is headed by Deputy Director General Dace Peleka.
The police are involved in saving two small children left without supervision, according to the State Police's government in Latgale.
The report on unsupervised baby carriages received on Friday at around 7 p.m.
They were in the Lives around the former shop building.
The two small girls are immediately put in the hands of the medics to provide help.
At the same time, in wheels, the bag was also left with papers and mobile phones.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement officers found out where parents could be and went there.
When they came to the home of a civilian, police officers found that a woman was sleeping because of a strong drink.
After an initial briefing on the evening of the previous day, a woman born in 1992 went to the gamble where she used alcohol.
After sitting together, the woman decided to leave the children at the shop as yet under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the Court of Justice of the events, which will also decide on the fate of children.
The Riga Free Port has implemented all the recommendations made by the CK on the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Port Authority has implemented all of the five overall State Control (PSC) recommendations on the development of the project infrastructure on the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal was informed by Diena.lv.
The approval of the project is planned at a forthcoming meeting of the Riga Free Port Management Board.
The Riga Free Port Authority also followed the findings of the legal and operational audit of the International Freeport Auditor Deloitte Rigas and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project at the subsequent stage of the project, with a view to implementing the recommendations.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the CPC today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Port Authority does not agree with the opinion on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are highly responsible for the project's implementation and the donor, the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction works planned for the project have been fully completed within the agreed timeframes and planned limits.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the CPC and also the facilitators, that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the CPC regarding the management and monitoring of the project," said Sanita Caire, the head of the Russian island project.
The long term operational plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was complemented by key planned actions by the parties concerned and deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definition and timing of meetings and regular reporting, the instruments for monitoring the planned construction process and the definition of major milestones.
The approved action plan to achieve the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the CPC, has been accompanied by monitoring measures for the implementation of the project, thus reinforcing the control by other parties of the Riga Free Port of the project's activities.
To improve project management and mitigate potential risks, a project management plan has been redesigned, defining the areas of project management and identifying the documents developed to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project capacity building structure has been developed for project management which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the planned project management team.
In order to improve communication between the Riga Free Port Authority and the stakeholders of the project, a communication plan has been drawn up which, in addition to the parties identified in the Project Action Plan, defines the stakeholders for the successful completion of the project, the principles, modalities and periodicity of the exchange of information.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, it will be necessary in future to justify in more detail the need to conclude a service contract or to launch a procurement contract and the rule of law.
As part of the project, the Russian island has constructed a port infrastructure that meets world standards: four new deep-sea links, rail links and engineering communications.
The structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into service at the end of the year already, with a financial saving of €10.6 million.
Threats in Slovakia have led to increased security at airports.
After receiving unspecific threats, Slovakia on Friday stepped up security measures at several airports, the Interior Ministry said.
"In view of the threat, we have tightened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Popray and Košice," a spokesman from the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
On September 16, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the Slovak capital, with the participation of all the countries of the bloc except Britain.
The summit will discuss the consequences of the Brexit referendum in Britain and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers discuss the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall."
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the communist yoke former East German border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, 1 841 people were murdered by the Communist authorities of West Germany between 1945 and 1989, trying to escape from their controlled territory.
The border museum has been investigating fatalities for years and adjusting the number of victims time and again.
This year, another 11 deaths are added to the list, including among the victims a six-year-old boy who drowned while the family tried to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also the Soviet deserters.
"The final damage caused by the double evil of Communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said Alexander Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape from a communist state are kept and kept alive," Hillary said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure 1841 is unconvincing," Johen Schtt, an expert in Berlin's history of East Germany, told Süddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
He, together with other researchers from the University of Berlin, is currently reviewing the alleged suspicious deaths at the border and has so far succeeded in confirming only 260 cases.
Earlier, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by communists around the Berlin Wall alone.
According to Schtan, the number of victims could reach around a thousand, considering people who have died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through neighbouring countries.
However, this is still significantly less than 1841.
Different methodologies could be one of the reasons for the varying number of victims.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide on the East German border guards, whether directly linked to their services.
The museum also lists non-violent deaths.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 died from a heart attack after breaking with border controls," it must have the consequences of this "murderous border," Hilldebrante said.
However, the House is convinced that a distinction must be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of the circumvention they experienced, and those who died as a result of prolonged waiting for a bus or coach at the border.
Regardless of this, the census of the victims is not easy, as the Communist authorities in East Germany failed to store such statistics, and researchers would need to send documents to the various scattered archives, it said.
However, the Storage Group has recently passed new documents, which is why it could present an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone to Rio has accredited a trainer; that is surprising.
In the last few days, Kaspars Pone, president of the Latvian Peled Federation (LPF), has been at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with the accreditation of the trainer, but is surprised by this.
The latest edition of the Olympic swimming coach Joseph Jakubovska said he had decided to go to the Pone in Rio for the last time, while the trainer had to stay at home.
Originally there were confirmed floors in the list of drivers, Park Ribakov and Uvis Kalnins, coaches Jakubovskis and Deivs Kolins, as well as the president of the Federation, Pone.
Aldon Vrublevskis said that Germans were going to be and were looking for tickets before flying out.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," Pone said, expressing his opinion that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvja coach conceded to help her.
As a member of the Executive Committee of the LOK himself, it was highly critical of the functioning of the LOK, which led to blame for the organisation that supervised the Olympic Sport.
As far as I am concerned, it is unethical for five persons to be approved by the executive committee and not taken by one of them.
"I do not know why the Pelsions Federation did not have any seats," Pone said that the work of the federation and its presidents had not been appreciated in society, recalling that the presidents of the federations did not receive any pay.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakov was not accepted among the participants, he complained to the International Federation for Water Sports (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone could not tell why he was in the Olympic Games with the accreditation of a trainer, who was probably due to Jakubovsky.
"I was nominated as president of the Federation (" team leader "), but I received training accreditation for unknown reasons and now nowhere in my home."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditation changed.
Until the last minute, I thought Germans would be, because I did not have any other information.
According to LETA, just a few days before the start of Ribakova, she had a conversation with the eyes of Poni and was with tears in the eyes of her son, but the LPF president himself said it was a regular conversation with the desire to mourn athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five sports activities in the Olympic programme, of which four are also undergoing training for children in Latvia.
The president of the federation said that drowning is also very important in Latvia, and also programmes like this, he spoke about when he was in Rio for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said the World Cup could take place in 2018 in Latvia.
The meeting in Rio is not my leave, I worked here, I spent my time and tried to implement the four year programmes.
600 000 young lakes will be released in Daugava.
During this week's recovery programme for Latvia's energo fish stocks, salmon and imp babies are being released in Daugava near the MangaIslands, and this year more than 600,000 one-year juveniles of salmon and imps harvested in the fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles are to be released.
Latvia tells LETA that the landing of fish will continue for the coming months, with a total of 6.300.000 juveniles and larval fish caught in the water bodies of Daugava basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, leagues and jokes will be released in June, lump summer salmon in July, August and September, cheese and quimps.
Maris Kunickis, director of the Latvian energy production, said that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvian energy concert.
"Any action to protect and reproduce fish resources is aimed at environmentally friendly activities, in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, through both the rearing and release of juveniles in the Daugava basin and other activities," he said.
More than 600,000 young lakes and strawberries will be released this year in the Daugava estuary.
For the second year now, juvenile fish have been marked with fat fins being cut.
Today there are 25,000 young lakes of an average weight of 31.3 grams on a pack.
Every year, juvenile fish and larval fish are allowed into the water bodies of Daugava and its basin.
Production of fish stocks in the water bodies of Daugava and its basin in accordance with the laws and regulations of Bior shall be carried out on the basis of an assessment of the damage to fish resources caused by the economic activity of Latvia and by providing an assessment of the compensation measures to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
The National Environmental Service, on the basis of that expertise, shall decide on the amount and nature of the compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvia for the fish stocks recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, in collaboration with the "We for fish," Latvia is deploying 400 artificial spawning nest, Daugava, near Kaibala and Ikzile, for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the Society to promote the natural spawning of the fish is a complementary initiative supported by the Latvian energo within the framework of the programme for the recovery of fish stocks.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in a water skin is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
At the festival, the brushing concert hall is the rural pasture, the forest, the circus.
Guli in tents, eats as a restaurant, keys and knowingly investigated camermusic to enjoy a silent nature peace - an alternative camera music festival called for the Anuseum in the third summer.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of Sussaga - no longer an existent village - in the back door, in the vicinity of the forests and in the circuses.
For a period of three days, from 12 to 14 August, a five stage can bring together the sophisticated enjoyment of natural and academic music.
The theatre and the contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest form, find young listeners in a free and open environment without the festival of concert medicinal products.
The distance from here to Riga is around 150 km, but only a few minutes feet to smile in the face and ease.
"Please do not look for the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not travel to one particular measure or to an artist, because the real taste can only be caught by spending all three days in it," says the instigator and master of the festival, operbariton Armands Stalins.
The festival's gate on Friday at 17: 00 and the first concert is at 7: 00.
Of course, there will be software on the ground with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, a Saturday is recommended because it is the most saturated: from 9 a.m. on 9 a.m. to the next daylight.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv," Armands Siliņš said.
The crowd is like Eva Bindere, Chelliste Blaumane, Operst Star Inga Kalna, rock star Gore Kuzma, tropet Janis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zarins, cadmium Derby and RIX and even the Estonian Air Acrobot Gross. Confines is an internal battle for the artist, along with Latvian musicians Eric Kirshfeld, Mark Zilbertu and actress Anci Strazda.
A special festival has also made works.
Kafka Kozlova and Jekabb Nile are among the motives of the Kafka program, along with the Armands Silin, musicians and activist Uģis Piterane.
Oscars Herman scored the first stage of the Stalinist quarter, while Anna Cirse - the Koku opera - performances, whose main heroes of the director of Andra Kalnozola, along with the video projections of Qatar Neiburg, and Andra Eaughter scenography, will be trees in three small puds of three hectares in the castle.
At the voice of Laimas Lediña, Dinar Rudy and Zigara Grash, they will end up in romantic relations, just like a study by Swedish science scientist Caral Linney, at the Enlightenment Age (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are opening one of Latvia's biggest hopes for the seven-year athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidina.
At 15: 35 pm, Dinamo will open a competition to 100 metres in the NBA square, while at 16: 50 am on the eve of the race.
In the night, it will begin at 2.35 a.m. while the sprint will start at 4.05 p.m. to 200 metres.
The seven-metre race will be closed on Saturday, when distancing, scrambling and a 800 metre race take place.
Ahead of the Olympic Games Ikauniece-Admidina, who last year won a bronze at the World Cup, was named as an Olympic medallist.
In May, Latvian added a new national record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-game race in Gecz, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidina also took part in the 2012 London Olympics, where she won the ninth place with the recalcitation of the Latvian record.
In the past year and a half, athletes have four times the country's record record record.
The first round of the Judo Municipality of Latvia will be held in Nizhikiforenko, the first round of which will be over 100 kilograms, with the Azerbaijani athlete Uhanis Kukauri taking part in the first round of the campaign.
For Jute, these will be the first Olympic Games in his career.
As reported, Latvian gay fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko was in the first fight in Latvia for up to 100 kilos on Thursday.
He conceded to the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who then won the bronze.
Wsevoloprid Zalony brought the Olympic bronze award to Latvia in 2000, while in the next four Olympic Games Latvian jouts have won only one win in seven battles in London, which was done by Borodavko.
Dainis Upelnieks will start the race at 16: 30 CET on Saturday, and the selection will be completed on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic Winston just on the day the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he told LETA that he had been quite safe for driving since April.
The Olympic captain is one of the first Latvian athletes to try to make the most of the training opportunities at the scene.
At 19.05, three rounds will be carried out by Ketija Birsse, a 17-year-old writer of the Olympic Games, who is competing to burn winds in RS: X.
In three days' time, in other words nine trips, Birzule is currently on 25 sites in a total of 26 athletes.
On Saturday, the final medals journey will take place.
Today, the Academy Cabinet, which is to take part in the Irish lator, Sanita Pusar, will also be hosted today.
The race was cancelled on Wednesday due to unfavourable weather conditions.
At 19.10, only one of the finalists will compete for the 13th edition of the Olympic Games.
On Tuesday she was in fourth place in a quasi-final trip, with a third line that would allow her to continue fighting for the medals, falling short of 0.65 seconds.
Pushpure's 13th place was won four years ago in London, when Ireland was also represented.
Today, the Olympic Games will distribute 24 medals: piloting, grey, tennis and scaling of tree cycling, bracketing, rampping, Judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and scaling.
She will appoint Garlande as a judge at the Supreme Court if Clinton is elected president.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid believes that if she becomes president she will nominate Merick Garlande as Chief Judge at the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party has blocked the approval of Garlande since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate majority leader Michel Makonnell said he would choose the next president to replace Antony Skaliu, the current Supreme Court judge.
Reid said she would be confident that Clinton would choose Garlande during her conference on Thursday.
Reida later said he had not spoken personally about the subject with Clinton and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garlande and said the Clinton team would not want to tear the boat with another choice.
Garlands is the main judge at the US Courts of Appeals in the Colombian region.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the Republican opponents blocking Garlande's nomination were "opponents" and they are acting in the interest of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the job of president-elect.
Treatment shall be notified of the cannabis calendar for women and men.
Journalist Treats will work with David Belmayor to set up the 2017 calendar at Pirreli in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 Life Days calendar for NCDs, it is planned to demonstrate new supermodels rather than blatant celebrities.
Earlier this year, the magazine's President St. Sushev said that his erotic art magazine differs from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a magazine of men."
This magazine is for women.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the calendar, Sushev said: "We have to return to a bitter and classic picture of wrangling, where the women's body is not confusing but inspired by both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is an excellent piece of art.
Models can send their photos to electronic or personal screening sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
It is the consumer who passes through the test of the motorcycle.
On August 10, a motorcycle called Yamaha YZ250, which has not been registered, was stolen in the courtyard of Rembates, the state police said.
The owner of the motorcycle wanted to sell the game by means of a preach.
At the agreed time, the potential buyer arrived, went on to the motorcycle as though it was coming in and leaving.
The police officers of the State Police Service of Riga Coal are asking for reference to be made to anyone who can provide any information useful for the investigation in connection with the crime that has occurred.
Requesting to call: 65002403 (while working) or 65002400 (all 24 hours).
Information providers shall be given anonymity.
Greenland's shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video test
Scientists say that Greenland's sharks have the longest life from all vertebrate animals on our planet.
Julius Nile, a shark researcher, says that the longevity record belongs to a mother, which could be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres old.
The French court rejects the request to dismantle shops in the 'Jungle' refugee camp.
A French court rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of self-established shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp where thousands of refugees live.
At a hearing in Calais this week, the authorities said that the state should dismantle 72 self-styled shops where people sell products such as cigarettes and energy drinks in the camp, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro self-eating restaurants.
In Calais, the Prefect Office said that these self-created companies need to be demolished because they constitute a black economy and do not pay taxes, as well as creating fire and sanitary risks.
The humanitarian group told the Court that these small businesses are essential because food provided by governments and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents is continuing to rise.
They also pointed out that self-created shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there are no legal grounds for expelling people who have created 72 self-established shops, but it understands the concerns of Calais.
Judge Žans-Francois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely insane conditions."
"These are peaceful places for refugees and volunteers," he said.
One of the sites at risk of demolition is the 'Jungle Book Kids' camp cafe, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French, and advises hundreds of unprotected minors on asylum issues.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition on the protection of a child cafe.
A letter addressed to Guardian states that the winding-up of a cafe would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
On Friday, two charities "Helping refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" said the number of residents of the Jungle camp had risen to 9,000, the highest since the influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins the silver regbij-7 playoffs when Fiji's national team wins the gold.
The final goal was a 43-7 win over the Dodoro Deodoro Rio Fiji, which led to a 43-7 loss in a 3-7 victory over the United States Grand Prix on Thursday.
Fiji exhibited the gold, the first Olympic medal in its history. Fiji showed them to control the ball, to play with their feet, to support the game and to play a brutal force.
The sweep brought the esteemed consolation prize - the silver medal that was in Britain's third coin this day - and the British exhibition can be proud of its success in the first Olympic rubbish-7 tournament in which they were beaten by New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Boks lost to Britain in the first half of their 7: 5 days.
But in any case Fiji is currently in its best shape to win 15 men.
Fiji coach Ben Ryan, a former England coach from Wimbon, could be a little consolation for Britain.
For Britain it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the play at the rugby 7 in Adelaid.
This time they lost only one game.
Saving is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji impressively started the match, restores British practices for joy.
Tusk will be in the lead with the World Cup champion Tom Michel and his comrades playing for the top 5: 0, when Osea Kolinisau won the first qualification.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the prevalence by blending on the right.
The result was 12: 0 and the British team had not even really touched the ball.
Michela did not allow Leoni Nakaravam to score three points, but that only had a slight impact on Fiji's result.
Jasa Veremalua got his way into the right corner in the seventh minute of the game, forcing the UK to 17: 0.
Nakarava increased the dominance after the match and had more than a minute before the end of the first half.
Mrs Ravouvou avoided some clumsy methods of British power and crossed the line by taking points.
The approach provided a result of 29: 0.
Fiji seemed to be born to play the regbia-7 matches, while the British are still learning.
In fact, that is true.
The British team made profound changes in the lunch by breaking Fiji's line... full four minutes, which was good after the first half, until Joshua Tuisova had a few more points in Fiji's team match after a fantastic match.
Deny Norton scored points for the left-leaning side in the left-leaning corner with 36: 7 and the game had already been lost, while South-East Farmers were singing, waving flags and dancing in the tribes.
Fiji's lively attitude cannot be admired.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even stronger with another concession at the end of the game.
Fiji could start to celebrate after the end of the game, but the British were able to sit down after the defeat.
Fiji defeated Japan 20: 5 in the first half of the day, while the British were superior to South Africa, where both teams were on the floor and the South phrases lost only a few points in a very fierce battle.
In the first half, Kails Brauns nominated Boks with the team, while in the second half, Den Norton crossed the line and brought the ball between the trusts to the club.
Mark Vatanen, who is a Anthony brother of England's regression of 15, secured the team's victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
Trener's fight against cancer is inspired by Helena Glover and Heteri Staning's victory in the airing race.
It will be the most emotional meal of gold in this race and it is already saying a lot.
Between the first and the last cancer, the gold of Helena Glover and Heteres Staningas played a special role in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they are only both athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by a Royina Wilders' return, which inspired them to get up to the second Olympic gold medals in rowing women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport to have achieved such success.
She doubtless dominated, because for the 39th time they won an unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with the bed elegant slipping on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
There is a whole team behind each of the golden medals that is working hard to ensure that athletes continuously improve their performance and that they contributed most to their success by a trainer who did not know until 30 months ago whether they would survive this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had the cancer of the urea, which is one of those that can and has been operational.
If it did not, it would spread through the whole body.
And the situation would get out of hand.
This changes your vision a little.
Fake cancer was discovered in December 2013.
It was fortunate that William could start the recovery process at the beginning of the 2014 season and reduce the duration of the interruption to a minimum, if I may say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This has stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked a distance of 6, 10 and even 15 metres, although the doctor said there would be a few steps.
It all started.
Airport is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was straight away about William, who was very worried all morning and who was more scared than usual.
Staning, who served in the Royal Artillery Union in Afghanistan, said, 'This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a great deal to me.'
It just confirms how much this means to us and how much I, Helene and Robin have worked.
The past 3 years of Hellenic and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so thank you very much to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Hetere Stanning have not lost in a few races in five years.
A couple is at such an enormous rate that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to get closer, the predominance of Standing and Glover was too high.
We felt every minute.
Helena shouted: "Look rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We managed to get a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of overthrowing record records, but simply of rowing and winning the race, and that is what we did.
A couple of years of rest will be taken to decide what to do next.
Next month there will be the Stalin's Bashala wedding on Glover and TV adventure.
For the time being, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
That would have been too much pressure.
I took about six months in London to realise that I was the Olympic Championship.
This was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, 'Greater is fantastic'.
A unique opportunity to look at the fantastic architecture of the Central Bibliotary building in Los Angeles.
Know more than the Central Library of the city, as the Association of Architectural historians from Southern California holds a meeting with the authors of the book Los Angeles Central Bibliotka: its Art and Architecture History, Arnolda Schwarzmann and Steven in Jall.
Ju and Schwarzman are planning to discuss and show the pictures of the Bertrama Gudhue design of 1926, as well as the 1993 restoration and Hardry Holcman's Fifer Team.
The meeting will take place on 21 August from 14: 00 to 16: 00 in Salle Moderne, Art Deco Dividwest Legal School (formerly Bullocks Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire.
Visitors will be able to visit central halls, exhibition rooms, nectus hall and tea rooms.
Tickets must be purchased beforehand; SAH / SCC members $15; others $25.
Mixed and ominous Farmers of the DTLA are undergoing domestic changes,
Recalling the 90th anniversary of the Central Library in Los Angeles - with whom? - as a new book!
Collegous will be "pushed to the bottom" as head of the Revenue Service.
According to him, Prime Minister Marim Kucinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai (Union of Greens and Farmers) are now "principled" to approve the Finance Minister's candidate Kolegova as head of the Revenue Service.
Rajevskis said that both Kučinskim and Reizniecei-Ozoka's approval of the head of the Revenue Service was the "first big decision" that could affect their future as politicians.
If the position of the Revenue Service's candidate is now to be changed, it will have a negative impact on their empty public administration.
The agenda of next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the transfer of VVD leader Kolegova to the Revenue Service's general director, according to the government's agenda.
Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola was nominated by Kolegova for the vacant post of the Revenue Service's head following Inara Petersone's resignation from the service's head and the competition for the Revenue Service's post ended without result.
Dace Peleka, the Revenue Service's executive, said in an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday 11 August that if she was offered a lead position, she could agree.
However, the Finance Minister later admitted that she did not consider other candidates for the Revenue Service's head.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the Saeima group, also said that the National Alliance was continuing to support Kolegova under the Revenue Service's control.
In Spain, the potential for budget cuts is being undermined by the failure to form a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued its opinion that Spain and Portugal did not take sufficient measures to bring their deficits down to the level of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
According to estimates, despite the austerity measures taken, Portugal's budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year, and Spain was 5. 1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the coming period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against the two countries, however, is the growing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only multiply such negative sentiments.
Critics point out that the EC is inconsistent in its decisions by agreeing on common rules from the outset and then unable to apply them in practice.
For example, Jenss Veidmanns, President of the German Bundesbank, said that Europe is losing its credibility in this way, giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendation rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for correcting their deficits until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission pledges in the coming months to examine the progress made by both countries, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts indicate that the target set for Portugal could be achieved in due course and the deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product earlier this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures to the tune of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget with an additional focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the deficit must be reduced to 4. 6%, next year to 3. 1% and 2018 to 2. 2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should represent 0. 5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
This is made particularly difficult by the fact that, for eight months now, Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the formation of a government, and Spain is increasingly likely to have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls suggest that the political scene of the third elections in the country would also be substantially altered.
The most popular party remains the popular party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, which would win more than 33% of the votes in the elections again.
Only the socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the Poldemos parties, or the 'Together we can' and 'Ciudadanos' or 'Citizens', have slightly decreased their popularity.
The People's Party wants to get socialists and Ciudadanos into government again this month, otherwise the draft budget for 2017 will not be adopted and submitted to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to the spokesman for the People's Party's parliamentary group, Rafael Hernando, if the government fails to establish and the parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing stock of Europe as a whole.
The purity of the bottles in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After studying beaches in the fifth year, activists conclude that the number of waste discovered has unfortunately increased every year, with the majority of bathing sites being responsible for this.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
The Capital believes that bathing sites are being cleaned every day and that it is very difficult to fight the dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left dry may be washed into water during torrential rain, thereby seriously damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beudmali and some places in Kurzeme, beaching purity in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This statement has been circulated this week by volunteers from the 'My Sea' campaign.
In the fifth year on the road along the Gulf of Riga, activists said the number of waste left by the population increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year its critical assessment has come to light.
"We can see that this will be the year when the number of waste per beach 100 metres may even exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme, spokesman for the expedition "My Sea."
According to Latvian Radio, he was on the beache of Los Angeles, where a voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga was continuing.
This year, even the fluorescent bulbs left in the sea sands have been removed between various types of household waste and the micycle stays.
The operator and the organiser Ulme teic are directly responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beaching visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, varied waste from bags, plastic parcels that are already at a turning point, they can no longer be identified and smoke, bottles, corks," Ulme said.
Among the dirty beaches, there are also bathing sites in Riga.
For example, on average nearly 800 pieces of waste were collected per hundred metres in Daugavsk, which is a critical mass.
The organisers of the campaign also make it clear that you smoke out at almost every turn and that there are no warning or ban signs everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites - Daugavins, Vacclalages and Adians - unfortunately come high and far above the desired objective, which Latvia is supposed to move to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental spokesman said.
The cleaning of places in Riga is done on a daily basis, the city's spokesman Uģis Vidauskis said during the summer days even twice.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who are prey, consume alcohol, smoke and do all things that cannot, even special signs, not work," said Vidauskis.
That is why Vidauskis is calling on visitors to the sites to report their pollution to the police as well.
One can call the police, safely point out these abuses and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps some new warnings can be made but, as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
"Since everyone should simply turn to and tolerate such offenders together," he said.
In the meantime, for the fourth time this summer, a health inspection was carried out, which could impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that all 56 bathing sites have had good water quality at all times and there are no bathing restrictions.
"The last time we take the analysis at the end of August," said Normunds Cadiz, the Senior Expert for Environmental Health.
Disturbing waste left on land during heavy rainfall can be washed into water.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, according to the Environment Officer.
Rotation in the Russian elite is continuing: change of head in the Putin administration.
The post itself was abandoned?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would have preferred to leave office himself and that he would continue to be the Special Representative of the President for Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin has spoken to Ivanovam in front of television cameras, saying 'Dear Sergej Borisovič, we have been working with you for many years and doing so successfully'.
I am satisfied with the way in which you are carrying out your duties.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you for more than four years in this post of Head of the President's Administration.
I am therefore conscious of your desire to change the scope of action.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role.
However, it is highlighted that the conduct of the presidential administration is a very important position and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
As the Duma elections are due to take place in Russia next month, rumours have been expressed that this step is linked to a power struggle in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement for Putin as president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take up the post of President for nature protection and transport raised doubts.
According to Archive Lsm.lv Ivanov is the KGB and the General Colonel of the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his journey with Putin in 1975 at the special service.
As Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, an Ivanova "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanovs became Russia's defence minister and in 2005 Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov was responsible for the development of Russian defence industries and arms exports.
Ivanov will now remain in the Russian National Security Council after the head of the presidential administration has left office, and the new head of the presidential administration Vaino will now be in office.
The picture comes from the elites of the family council party.
Vaino, the head of the president's administration, was appointed by Ivanov himself.
We have known Antonu Eduardovicius a long time ago.
Out of those days when we were in government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we have been in touch practically every day.
"That's why I am sure he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The picture comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karls has held senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including the first secretary of the Center for 10 years until 1988.
The "Meduza" newspaper, referring to the book "Estonia's self-determination and independence," said Karls Vaino had asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators in the late 80s.
However, he had received the refusals and had lost his post shortly.
Shortly afterwards, the landscape has moved to Moscow.
Antony Vaino has graduated from Moscow's Institute for International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work on the administration of the presidential protocol.
As reported, the latest ungenerous Russia has been shaken by the suspension of several senior officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several governors and federal representatives.
President Vladimir Putin is reshuffling the ruling elite ahead of the 2018 elections, according to politologists.
One of the main features is that more and more members of power structures are occupying leadership positions.
The judo fighter, Nikiforenko, also loses in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the first fight, and Latvia's Janis Battlegroup has finished its membership of the Olympic Games by finishing in 17th place.
Treneris Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that there was very little hope for Nikiforenko, and that was already clear before the competition.
He also said that the Jano millionaire had a trauma in the fight.
Significantly, in order to get the Olympic Truce Mark, Newikiforenko had to start in another weight category than it had been spent - that is, in the weight category, up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani fighter was 25 kilograms heavier.
As reported, Jevgeny Borodavko stayed for two and a half minutes in the fight against Rjunosuki, while the conservative went for a clean win.
That is why Latvia has made the Rio Judo race a close.
The crowds are disappearing in Rio sand.
Yevgeny Borodavko was inaugurated on Thursday.
Yes, he had a more heterogeneous opponent in return, but ambitious sometimes comes as a surprise.
He did not come.
The task of Arusha Nikiforenko was even more difficult, because experience is smaller and respectable.
The result was similar when he stayed almost one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, there has been a lack of ambition on the one hand in Latvia.
Gunars Kirsons and his financial stute Vladimir Šestakovs have left Alexander Jackevic in Latvia since he left the head of the federation.
The protesters who are advising Kazakhstan's Janjaweed here and Vsevoldam Zalony do not see the heirs.
But if you don't grow, there will be no.
And it is the prerogative of a federation.
That is why Rite Panorama, among other galaxies, was the promise made by the president of Latvia's Judo Federation to Rio win the medals.
Flight flight far from reality.
On the evening, Samoilovs / Schmetennins - Evandra / Pedra Solbergs - welcomed the beach voyleyball match with eagerness and concern.
The losers are at the end of the game as they are in the 'death' group.
The Latvian duel was a small digression, with a loss of four points and a maximum of four points in two matches.
There was a long past game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling above the wall of the cold corta on the wall.
For the players, the snowballing wind caused further complications.
At the beginning it seemed that it could be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive -.
But it did not get.
It was quite simply enough to play the Latvian duetu here.
Serve to Samoilova and the waiting for him to burst.
Canada was plunged, Cuba plunged at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not along the joke.
It could have been fished at that time because there was little work, but when there was, it did it honestly.
Samoilovs scored two goals for the first round, with 16: 15 in the first round, but 16 in the second half, the same was the same as the lost point.
But we also lost 0: 2, as the shortfall in the second six was -4, but thanks to the wind we managed to win.
The third has already gone to the Conservative Evanders.
A successful chain: poorly embraced, the second match often flies far too close to the network and Samoilovam left very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilovs in the field against the Cubans, he worked better this time, and it would be unprofessional to carry the loss to him alone.
The left was wrong too, and it was symbolically enough that he was shooting the last bombings.
The team is in loss.
This time, there was certainly a lack of success: in the third set, two attacks by Evanders were almost out of the hot air, but the ball was still on the line.
Two flights were in the vicinity of the line.
The contested episodes were also in favour of opponents.
If Evandra was torn with the Serb in the first two games, then it was very productive for us.
Everything was put together in the loss on the taboo.
Now the reasons for the failure need to be calmly analysed.
Perhaps it should have been like many living side by side with the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It was two and a half hours away.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a semi-finals.
Perhaps there was no need to play in Kngenfurt, but to come here more quickly and acclimatise better.
Maybe it was a mistake to find the top of the sport.
So far, more questions than answers.
Our bishops are at the end of the game.
The spiral over the medals.
What happens next?
Some of the tournaments of the World Cup and also the Masters of Jurmala have left.
Symbol with Samoilova has never been friends and will not exist, because there are too different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise, as the blame will be sought not only in oneself but also in the partner.
Distribution is not difficult, but it will be much more difficult to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
The two brothers are playing the ball, but Janis and Toma have already tried and are self-evident, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to get up to the top of the world.
Harare Regžu, Alexander Soloveya, Edgar Tovins, can try to return to Maris Pelessman, but it will not be better than this one, which proved itself at the stage of the World Cup alone.
The sands of timber did not smile for them this time.
And all.
Of course, we also have to take into account the fact that beach voyleleyball is becoming more popular, young people are entering the chain, and only a rare fruit is less than two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success, but it is an important argument in the battle for victory.
Nowadays, the longer is not the longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to live in places offered by the organisers and to choose their own.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, part of the rival does not remain in the Olympic village.
Also, some of the beach voyleleyboliths have found a hotel in Copakaban.
This time, the rather modest overnight accommodation of journalists was demanded of heavily exaggerated prices.
That is why the choice fell on the hire of apparatus.
The risk is, because sometimes it may be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with the rental of Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir, apparatus on the border between Copakaban and Ipanham.
I've spent 200 metres away, my cab's arid half an hour in a march.
The area is quite safe, because favelas are patentable, but vigilance must not be lost there either.
Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Putin is not what some people imagine immediately, but the most professional sports journalist, Vladimir Ivanov, on the Russian media.
A second dream of medals was dreamed out of the morning of Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidina lost his personal record in the 100 metre square and high jump.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, Porgijs and Besa read in Liepaja.
The Latvian operation Porgijs and Besa went to the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised singer has not yet been produced again.
This is why the organisers of the Art Festival and the Liepaja Arts Forum have decided to give the listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Guerchina's host.
"We are very pleased that, after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy opera's entrance, this excellent version of the concert hall of George Guernsey and Besa is apt to us in the new" Great Car "concert hall," said Baiba.
"Porgijs and Besa" is a vivid story of love, its volatility, passivity, as well as household tragedies and simple everyday subsistence.
It reflects the afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance, that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way deep," says Viesturs Cairo.
What I like most - listening to or bringing this operation to light - is always such a point of contact - the famous melodges, the famous motives, but these crossings from one character to another, highlighting one person or another, or a cork or an orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this construction," said Porgijs and Besa's musical manager and conductor Andris Poga.
Visitors to the site agree that this is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear this famous Guerchina opera in the world.
It is encouraging that in Liepaja one can feel the breath of the world.
"Professional performance" is assessed by Edgars Lame.
The concert was particularly worded by the fact that, in the newly discovered "Great King" hall, the orchestra played an orchestra for the first time in the orchestra, and the first time the opera concert was held.
The square around the Art Museum could be named after Jay Rozental.
Riga Vice Chancellor Andris Ameriks at the launch of the Rozenthal jubileya exhibition, said the museum's own address could be not in the future, but the square of Jay Rozental 1.
Murray, director of the museum, admitted that reregistering the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but overall the idea was welcomed and therefore agreed with the local government's proposal.
The city of Riga has put a kind of basic stone to this idea in 1936, creating a Burkara Dzestan monument to Janim Rozentar, which is standing in front of the museum.
The then museum director, Vilhelms Purvitis, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be quite logical.
What kind of consciences do me all the time - but Vilhelms Purvitis, where are we going to put his name down?
"But if you, Mr America, promise to think," said Luce.
The National Art Museum building was officially opened in May this year after extensive reconstruction and modernisation.
At the end of this week, VEF Culture Castle is to be reconstructed.
Around €11 million will be restored to Welve.
Several Palace rooms are planned to be renovated, including two spectators, as well as the building to be adapted to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to mobilise EUR six million in EU funds for the project, but Oleg Burovs, Director of the Riga City Council's Property Department, admits that the project is not yet fully clear on European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start renovation of the ETF's cultural pivotal role in mobilising the European Structural Funds is there, we are waiting for a decision for months, real action from officials in the Ministry of Finance, the money will be granted or not," Burovs said.
In December last year, we were told that everything was up to Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you yourself decided that Brussels did not take a decision here.
Now we are seeing another circle of discussion emerging, so let us see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council will no doubt guarantee that this process will be initiated and completed in time," he said.
As reported, more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Castle was organized jointly to renovate the building shortly.
Although a year later, the renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively under inappropriate conditions.
The Riga City Council's Property Department's strategy for the VEF Culture Castle's renovation is divided into supposedly independent redesign packages, where each will ensure that different Castle functions are implemented.
First, increasing access to the VEF Culture Palace and improving the surrounding area.
It sets out to clean up surroundings and engineering communications and renovate the building's façade.
Second: improving the supply of MEF cultural palace services.
It plans the restoration of the building's interior, walls and ceiling, the improvement of the stage and sound recordings and the cleaning of the building's internal engineering communications.
Third: improving working conditions for Creative amateur societies, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Ahead of the 40th anniversary, the legitimate rock group can be found at an exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover various "Lives" items - photographs arranged over the time line to reflect the group's performance from start to 2010, when the group is announced to end.
The participants' spectators, musical instruments, awards and concerts will also be shown, as will other things that have not yet been seen for the wider public, which reflected the creative activities of the "Lives" group.
The exhibition will be supplemented with the objects of the Liepaja Museum.
The exhibition's visual form has been developed in collaboration with the fashion artist and the Elita Patmala painting giant.
Musicians who have been associated with the Love group and their relatives also responded to the appeal and shared their objects and memories.
The "Lives" dates back to 1972 when the Liepaja Culture House created a vocal instrument anvelty headed by Juris Pavtol.
In 1972 and 1974, as well as the cities and republics, Ansamblic played an initial part in the festival Liepaja Armed in 1972.
In 1966, a fatal meeting took place when Juris Pavito took place in the presence of Event and Metalurgs at the cultural Palace, calling for the accession of Ingride Ghent, Andri Krumins and Jani Groduma.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been noticed no more than once.
Participants have joined, others have travelled, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to affirm that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existence remains unchanged.
"What was not missing - the noble, the hair and the bardfish, these boys were noticably different from the commonly accepted type of doctor," says Music Review Class Wars.
Among the musicians mentioned above were outstanding musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Kriehe, Modris Shark, Valdis Štark, Laimis Rutbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brise, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Kleins, and many others.
An exhibition shall be free of charge.
The exhibition is available from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, Liepaja concert garden Pukt, winds will take place in the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Liepaja concert garden LĪVIFest 2.

Zbigniew Stankevich: Now it's time and the truth upstairs.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevich, in an interview with Independent Independent Commander, stresses that the Gospel message must be put at the centre of the Latvian Catholic Church if we want to gain force.
Because the force of truth is greater than the whim of the evil.
Many are already on the way to the Wholesale New Delhi Olympics in Aglona.
What message will the believers get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main religious service in Aglona has been expressed by the Pope's nuncium.
Consequently, the content of the key message is also up to him.
The fact that bishop Janis Bulis runs the Krusta route is also a kind of tradition.
He, too, will form his own message.
I hosted a religious service of a festive vignette last day.
Last year, I addressed Pope Francis's "Laudato si" and updated the theme of the common home, the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... I am, of course, watching what is happening in the world and trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel's storm should be put at the heart of life.
The Gospel must show that it responds to the most pressing problems in human life and gives him an inspiration to the way forward.
Then it addresses the people.
But you said in the English Channel discussion that "we need to get back to an understanding of the pilot person."
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person has turned away from a church's message?
And does the Church have such a return resource today?
In the Indian capital, a man who is dying on the side of the road is being plundered.
In the Indian capital, no one has ever known about a dead man on the side of the road, who appears to have put an hour on the road and then robbed, the BBC said.
The man who has been identified as Myllin is reported to have a daily ride and worked as a guard at night.
A car 5: 30 went to home in the morning when he was shot down by a car.
The entry of the screening cameras shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour when no one was aware of the bloody man, he was robbed by a spiritual brain.
About 90 minutes after being torn down at the site, the police arrived and the victim was taken to hospital where he died from the injuries suffered.
Referring to his candidacy for the post of State Revenue Service Director General Inga Kolegova has saved the government from the fall, according to Professor Oir Skudra, Associate at the University of Latvia's Social Science Faculty.
Colleagues' explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
In an interview with LETA, Skudra said it was difficult to imagine that at the government meeting next week Unity would support Kolegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if the Unity ministers were to vote against and Kolegova were approved anyway, that would lead to the resignation of the government.
He also believes that before announcing his withdrawal, Kolegova has consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Maris Kucinski.
At the same time, it was a concession to Unity, which was firmly opposed to her candidacy.
He said that "we have two options: either a compromise figure will be selected or the Authority will continue to lead the post of Director General in Dace Peleka."
At the same time, he says that if the finance minister so far stated that no other candidate was being considered, it is a signal to the Bake people that she could not take part in the contest.
As reported, the head of the State Environment Service, Kolegova, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the Revenue Service's head of state.
The government on Tuesday suspended the approval of Kolegova as head of the Revenue Service for a week due to the Unity's objections.
Kolegova said he was still ready to become head of the Revenue Service after the government decided to postpone its decision.
However, she later thought it was changed: in an application to Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozoka on Friday she said she would withdraw her consent to the transfer to the Revenue Service's position and would not be an easy choice.
Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis' spokesman Andrejs Vaivars told LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of head of the Revenue Service.
At the centre of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
At the centre of Riga this afternoon, a road traffic accident involving a national police car was taking place.
A police car with enclosed sound and light signals has rushed to the top category until another car was intercepted at the intersection of Critical Barona and Dzirnavu Street.
The police explained the situation, but initial information shows that the second game has not missed a police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
This year in Riga the population is shrinking
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 residents in Riga, down 0.34% from 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Bureau informed.
In terms of population, the capital ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to Eurostat, the highest proportion of women is found in Riga, with the capital of Latvia ranking strongly among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three Baltic capitals, women represent the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
There will be warning pictograms at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs will be deployed at the Latvian National Art Museum (LNMM), a spokeswoman for the Riga City Council's Property Department, Baiba Gailite, told LETA.
Removing the damage of the museum glass, which was the result of the actions of the scethenders, has now been successfully completed.
The warning pictograms will be deployed at the site in the coming days.
Its citizens will be told that they can be ill and snow, they can't travel with cars, they can travel with bicycles, their rubbish and their rubbish.
Ushakov also wrote on Facebook at the time, saying that there is no risk of damage to security, but "there are no akurates," and the scanner "will have to heal."
New children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
During the summer season, the local government of Riga has installed two new playgrounds in the city, Channel and Chiekurkala, which are already available to children.
A vast multifunctional robot ship with various lashing elements, bridges, games, trubs and snipers has been installed on the beach of the Channel.
The Royal Square is for children of all ages.
The agricultural area also includes cells and various balancing elements.
In the world of anthropy, small sailors are trapped in the mine in Daugava with a view to the port of passengers and cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, crowd has been placed in the playground between Chiekurmon (4) and 5, a potato house, a batch, a steestone tram, a bridge of balance, cracks, rotaps and other game elements, as well as a gymnastical zone with purse seines for exercises of strength and coordination, co-texts, etc.
There is a field covered by rubber cover in different colours.
Until the playground there was a new, colourless cover on the street.
The hunts reveal a reconstructed road section.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, CEAS Latvian State Roadways (LVC), as well as construction workers Binders and local authorities today unveiled a section of the state-constructed main Russian motorway border (Grebneva) - Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medals to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Road is a state visit map, especially the border roads, so it is particularly gratifying to open a reconstruction phase on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"According to the forecasts, the funds available for the roads will be absorbed already in 2018 during this planning period, and we need to think about how to continue to sustain the busiest motorways of a very good quality and also ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without EU funding," Uldis Augulis emphasized the symbolic ribbon.
The Transport Minister also said that the proposals for sustainable financing of Latvia's roads would be presented to the government in the near evening.
Binders started construction work last year from the hunt to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163.05 km) and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT), which was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The road design has been fully reconstructed and repairs will be launched next year from the honey to the Daugavpilij itself, bringing the whole road from Lithuania's border to Daugavpilij," said Janis Lange, chairman of the board of the LVC.
The country's main motorways are the most burdened, and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all the country's main motorways are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring periodic maintenance and the replacement of the asphalt by 7-9 years each time.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers look forward to the proposals put forward by the expert group to clean up the road financing system," Mr Lange said.
The project connects roads and lighting in the centre.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four phases, large scale distillation and massive injection and embankment work, equalized the road longitudinal profile, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport facilities have also been restored and a public transport area has been rebuilt.
In the past, there was insufficient capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old path to the common topography.
In the next construction season, the road section will be restored from the Daugavpils city border to the reconstruction phase (144,80-156,40 km).
This year the LVC intends to carry out various types of work in more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
All repairs planned on the national road network this year are available on the LVC website www.ence.lv.
"The correct choice of food combinations is essential to achieve the desired reduction in weight," said Laura Romeraite-Coastlieriene, Lithuanian diethology.
Moreover, it is easy to do this during the summer period, when our own gardens grow fresh fruit, berries and vegetables.
The combination of healthy dietary products can help not only to reduce overweight, but can also make a targeted contribution to the various organism processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, since they provide a lasting sense of satiety and help to combat fats.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition magazine have shown that the label has a positive effect on blood glucose and helps us to feel encouraged.
Shai pipari and protein rich meals, such as poultry or protein cocktails, create not only a sense of satiety, but also reduce the cards for large meals in the following meadows.
Such a combination of meals can also increase the calorie incinerated by meal to 35%.
Studies show that Xai pipari can help to get rid of fats in the vein.
The eggs contain a cholin nutrient which contributes to metabolism, while the paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
The presence of sufficient quantities of these nutrients can lead to a reduction in cortizol levels, thereby also reducing the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
There is a second long and fat burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in its menu.
Sheep beds and berries contain fibres which, according to Canadian scientists' findings, control digelin - an appetite stimulating hormones - and thus a sense of hunger.
Furthermore, ports contain polyphenoles which are assistants for weight reduction and prevent the formation of fats.
Vegetables and proteins can also do miracles in the reduction in weight.
Such a combination is capable of generating a sense of sympathy.
Vegetables contain water and fibre and therefore contribute to a sense of satiety.
At the same time, proteins are slowing down the digestive process and providing a sense of salt for a long time.
At lunch you can eat a chicken with sweet or make protein cocktails from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it together with your favourite vegetables.
Which product combinations can be avoided.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, starch found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruits disperse mechanically and chemically do not divide up until they reach the third or fourth stage of the digestive process taking place in the arsenals.
Starches are divided into three different stages starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the codend immediately after the meal.
When you eat the codend immediately after the meal, it is "stuck" in the stomach with other foods, where it is not chemically taken and started to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, equidae, bananas, computers or other carbohydrate products, together with citrus, luck, orange, digestate, anasles or other acids.
Enzyl pthyaline contained in salts operates only in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids hamper not only the capture of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheeses and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk, nuts and milk and a similar combination of protein rich products into the same diet.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and times to reach the stomach.
Architecture, medusmelon, muscle and other melons must always be eaten separately from other meals.
Melons are not captured if they are in the herring with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein rich products.
Fats form a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein: fat hinders the capture of protein.
Protein can be combined with very small amounts of fat.
If a large quantity of protein products is consumed, avoid the use of fat altogether.
This also applies to freshness: it is not advisable to combine a large quantity of nuts (containing protein) with a whole source of kado (containing fats).
Such a combination hinders the effective reduction of weight.
How can we make better preparations?
"Cooking, thermal treatment leads to significant nutrient losses of between 15% and 55% of the initial nutritional composition of the products," said dietology.
In most cases, nutrients are lost through the collection of food in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods is increasing, precisely by means of a collection.
In this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and will be able to eat them at a later date.
The gardens are advisable to prepare them, including through evaporation.
Thermic treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of tomatoes.
With less than 30 minutes of tomatoes, the quantity of lime will increase by 25%.
Thermal processing also significantly increases the availability of betacaromethane bioavailable in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, the Balkans, sweet potatoes and spins.
The thermic treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural characteristics of the proteins contained in them, making them more removable.
Likewise, the treatment of meat and egg thermic makes the iron and other minerals of these products more readily absorbed into the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while freezing fibre does not affect.
Compliance with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better functioning of the brain and muscle.
Our organism absorbs up to 33% of the less non-blood iron found in plant products such as beans, sheets green, cereal products than blood-creative iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood iron by using products containing non-blood iron together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and coal for human consumption.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Railways are needed for the production of chemoglobaline, which ensures that oxygen is supplied in muscles and brains.
To maximise the benefits of strains, add healthy fats such as olive or flax oil.
In preparing for butter with read, add an additive yoghurt, which is a good source of calcium, to vitamin D for wealthy salmon or sardines.
Vitamin D increases the calcium absorbed in the lake and plays an important role in the bone formation process.
Words (as well as other full-grain products), together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, swimmers, hauls and other fruits or coal, contribute to stabilising cholesterol levels and avoid artery.
Snapchat's Anime crisis criticized Chinese caricatures
The representatives of Snapchat say that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators say it is racist.
With this sluggish effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their own identity in a rather absurd way every day.
You can turn yourself into an ancient, dog or image that would be in the Roja Lihshtenstein Gladen.
Courses are spray, imaging instruments that produce more than 30 million converted selfia per day.
Any mistake is quickly made public.
The snow effects of Snapchat have been criticised in the past, with the accusation that the application is promoting too black or a glue tea as an ideal beauty benchmark.
New sluggish effects were published this week, allowing users to build their eyes, swords and shoes stars, and some critics called it racist Asian cartoons, the yellow giants.
The question was also raised as to whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has a greater problem with diversity.
News and public negativity erupted on Wednesday, when The Verge and Motherboard said sluggish effects had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the aim of the lunch was to portray the image of Anime rather than caricature the people of Asian origin.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects have highlighted painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
Greisas Sparapani, an American art student of Korean origin, received a big resonance on Twitter in an email letter saying the sluggish effects were "offensive and inconvenient, to say the least."
She added that it is difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between asiate cartoons and sluggish effects.
This shows that the slower effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in terms of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has entered this cultural trap.
The American culture is also involved in the endless battle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people from different backgrounds, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If the Snapchat lenses create a image that insults users, "things do not remain unnoticed nowadays," Keitiy Zou, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Medium's product manager Žou extinguished his application to Snapchat and recommended that others do the same.
In her article "Medium" and telephony, she explained that she felt that the problems related to the race were due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
He criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in an enterprise, and so are some other people of race working in the company, but they do not hold such a post in order to be able to express their opinions safely and comfortably," she said.
She shares her opinion, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different race, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but his spokesman revealed that the company was rewarding a specialist of staff, who will focus on the representation of racial minorities in the company, who are not well represented and who will contribute to the integration of the company.
On the other hand, Žou will not renew his account of Snapchat, adding that "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right."
The Congress House states that military officials have distorted the reports of Islam.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Congress says that US Central Command representatives have distorted the reports, depicting the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
The chief intelligence analysts expressed general dissatisfaction at the interim report by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republicans of the Defense Finance Subcommittee, which said their management controlled reports of American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tamp, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report shows that the intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is actually the case: the facts were regularly misrepresented, presenting better results than other intelligence analyses.
Californian Republican spokesman Ken Kalvert said: "Centcom's action is unacceptable: our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
The mistakes of the Centcom leadership lie in the top management of the organisation.
This 10-page report describes in detail the existing problems in the coverage and analysis of the Central Command's efforts to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide compelling evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration would have caused the reports to be distorted, it shows that the Centcom leadership has exerted some pressure on analysts to present a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that in the first half of 2015, central administration press releases, statements and reports to Congress portrayed the situation in a much more positive light than was the case.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that Mosul's recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
Nick Pompeo, the Republican Party's spokesman, said in her report: "A series of months of investigations have shown this clearly."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the main officials of the US Central Administration distorted the reports, depicting the ISIS threat to the weakest in Iraq than was actually the case.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the inquiry continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by further findings on the matter.
The Inspectorate General of the Ministry of Defence is conducting an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The Democratic Party of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday issued its own report in which they agree with some of the Republican Party's conclusions.
In his report, Centcom was too restrictive in its assessment of intelligence reports concerning ISIS and Iraqi security forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr Šifa explains that this process' stopped the dissemination of information ', worsened the ethics of analysts' work and 'spread facts that were not true'.
But Shifs and Democrat members added that there is no evidence that White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to "pre-defined or political positions."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress inquiry on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Inspectorate general of Pentagon launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Patriarch Evans said Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continues.
He added that experts sometimes interpret complex data and the Defense Ministry and the intelligence agency are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation does not just address the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (a statement made by an increasing number of defence ministries).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can rely entirely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reminds us of more than a decade of ancient events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs Hugker released a study saying that the George W. Bush administration started the war in Afghanistan with too little thought for its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in detecting the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hugkera team discovered that, in contrast to public reports, air strikes at Islamic State oil factories had not made the financial situation of the terrorist group significantly worse, as they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Administration.
Meanwhile, Centcom commander General Loids Ostins III received sharp criticism because many lawmakers felt that war reports described the situation too positively.
General Ostins took his leave in April and General Joseph Votels took the place of his seat.
The US dug with Britain in the Women's Ice Hockey wins the United States, thereby winning the fourth consecutive win.
Keitii Bama scored the first two goals for the U.S. Women's Ice Hockey team in a 6-1 victory over Japan on Thursday.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but a 27-year-old Bama said that he could not remember whether such a thing would ever have been successful.
She said, 'I have no idea'.
I am not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the American result at the Olympics is 4: 0, which gives them an unrated in their group with Britain, which on Thursday, after winning Japan 2: 0, did not win.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play their first round of the last match.
The two teams are already qualified for the fourth finals, and the game will only determine who will take the first place in the six-team group and who will play the second.
The winner of the first prize will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch selection, which is the leader of the second group, a little longer.
Be that as a Saturday game, the American has already sounded a storm of surprise, with the last of 12 teams in London four years ago.
Bama was also on the team
She grew up in Blub, took the field hockey for the first time at 3 years of age (her eldest twin sisters already employed this sport in Drekselle) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest player in history.
She was not at the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not reach the final.
However, 2012 was an unfortunate year for her and her team.
The next year, Anglis Kregs Parhams was appointed as a coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
We did not put as much work into London as we did now.
We have changed everything.
Bama scored a goal in the first half of the first half with a throw from a close distance.
India launched the game without win in its own account, but it was very tough and held a minimum 0: 1 to the end of the third period, when Bama scored a goal again.
She pulled the ball into the rankings on the left side of the square and went out to the middle of the square and pulled out a ball against her in the American goal of 2: 0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalesa scored one more goal.
This was the first dry game in Bruges of the U.S. goalkeeper, with one goal in each of the first three games.
She has sketched.
And as well as Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Paham, but how good it's, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing meal of the depression period is "Intelligent Maltese."
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Frenklins Delano Ruzvet sat in an ovaguay room to defeat the Maltese.
President Rucancanned a garden of fine gastronomy depots such as a soos corner or a futile robbery of Merilde's turtles.
But on that day his meal was much more modest: a puppet of eggs, a potato thick and a dessert.
James Ziegelmane said: "This is a way to show solidarity in food preparation with people who were very hard hit."
Her husband, Andris Kou, adds: "This is also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple from the Brooklyn Heights district is a meal for historians.
Cou's last book Drought described Chinese kitchen in America and Ziegelmane's book 97 Abele describes life through the eating House in the outskirts of Manhattan.
Their new joint work on the "Intelligent Maltese," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story of the American Easter Depression.
To show some solidarity in gastronomy, they held a meal together of the reporters Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, in a simple lunch building in the Flatirona district from 1929, when the great depression began.
Mrs Ziegelmane, 54, ordered a butter with a melted cheese and a captured olives, while a 57 year old Kou ordered a turkey, potato thick and vegetable sweet.
When a reporter commissioned a fake lady, the couple said his choice was very appropriate to talk about the Easter Depression Day.
Mrs Ziegelmane said that the counterfeit chicken was very popular.
There was a peanuts lake, a stone and a bottom-stone green.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine, as it were, to eat so many peanuts that they were in the place of lunch.
Mr Kou was shouting.
"I probably thought the wind was full of lead," he said.
In the years prior to depression, the American lunch table was like the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat their male and female workers and breakfast, freshly prepared biscuits were given lunch and dinner.
During the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans food: the 'Intelligent Maltese' describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances where America suddenly no longer had the land of abundance.
"At the time, food became the centre of attention of the American people on a daily basis," said Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on this subject.
The new budget diets became just as important: unknown food such as the fake green and the indignation became everyday, the indignation was "an excellent way of using the surpluses," Mrs Ziegelmanes said, as the cooks could conceal unattractive ingredients under cream.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which was the main component of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the calorie number and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, yet unseen, formations were born.
In an ancient book, Mrs Ziegelmane found a recipe for making a tiny puzzle with a peanuts.
Mr Kou adds: 'This was not a popular addition to the lunch table'.
Ms Ziegelmane emphasizes: 'It was surreal'.
Peanuts are not compatible with a tiny butter and a kind of dirty.
Many home-food prescriptions applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stenlia, head of the Federal Office for the Economics of Homeland for the years 1923 to 1943, laid down national eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and prescriptions in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that households become "economists" and take on challenges such as turning the macaroni and carrot mix into a spiritual meal.
'Intelligent Maltese 'is a body of historic longevity.
Particularly interesting is evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Hamver 'let me eat a cake' attitude.
Although in public he talked about his simple childhood and catering in Aiova, he was actually eating as a fine millionaire that he had become.
Mr Kou says: 'He liked the cucumber kitchen of Europe, for example'.
He was eating almost a golden waiter wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely disconnected from reality.
President Rehn would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not advised him to set an example by his eating habits.
The book said that Ruzvet had set off a domestic worker who did not teach to eat, so White House became the place where not only one of the most heinous food was delivered in Washington, but also the worst prepared meals.
As soon as the national economy recovers, most of the custodians of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, as well as on how to apply science in gastronomy, said Ms Ziegelmane.
A couple are telling us that, when they wrote a book, they gained a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs Ziegelmane, for example, why she was unable to throw away food.
"She was really afraid to throw away the food," said Mr Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmane said, 'She actually pulled the people out'.
There was once an incident with wind melts.
When we had eaten the Eisenberg in the estuary, the writer took a desert from the Finnish home: a potato that President Rehn used to eat at at lunch.
"This is a pick-up," said Ms Ziegelmane, adding that at the time there was a common habit of giving modest meals a shot.
It does not contain seabirds, only dried floodplains, a little meal, sugar, water and canal.
Everyone impatiently buried the flags in the brown mass on the plate.
Surprisingly, it was not that bad at all.
Mr Kou eaten a few more cumosus.
Speaking after an experienced "economist," he wife said: "a puppet snake would desert a nut."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck's Hepatitis C patent
A provincial judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement for the legal services it paid in the case of the Brexit Hepatitis C patent against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a penalty payment of 200 million pounds for the removal of two Merck patents which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a US federal judge found irregularities in Merk's activities, such as hunting after being sworn and other unethical acts.
At the hearing on Thursday, a US district judge, Bets Labson Friemens, said that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses he had incurred.
Merck is trying to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which is dominated by the new generation of Hepatitis C, which is effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active component sophospbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicinal products.
U.S. forces say they have completely taken control of the city of Manbida from the Islamic State.
The US-backed forces have completely taken over Manbida City in the northern part of the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city from the latest opponents who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2 000 hostages of civilians captured by militants, Sharf Darvias from the military council of the SDS allied to Reuters told Reuters.
"Today the city is under our full control and we are searching for the fighters," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and a couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
Hillary Clinton issued his 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband had earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Clinton has donated $1 million in 2015, mainly to his charity for Clinton, and former president Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million in his role as a spiral and former state secretary has earned $3 million in his book on his work in the National Departamenta, published in cooperation with Simon & Schuster.
Tim Kein, Senator of Virginia State, and his wife, Anna Holtone, have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tims Kein continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmiere said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind various pretexts and excuses so that promises to disclose his tax information do not have to be kept.
Disclosure of nominee tax information is a record practice for candidates to the US President, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention the audit of the National Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move,"? Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sams said in her Twitter account.
Trump's special advisor Michael Kohens told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before completing the audits.
Trump's critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republican presidential candidates in 2012, say his refusal raises questions about his real value of property, donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton poured the oil in the city by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential rebels are calling on Trump to publish his tax information.
She returned to the issue again during an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico says Trump has paid very little or no tax for two years in the 1990s and the New York Times business column said Friday that many accountants and lawyers believed that nothing has changed today either.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton is promoting the idea that anyone who earns more than USD 1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%, supporting the proposal of the billionaire Varena Bafeta.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebrascus, where his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is located, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Bafet said he was also being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump feared voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton now lives in Chapakva, New York and, between 2007 and 2014, paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only USD 100 of their income is wage.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes the hotel in Berlin over the closure of Israel's long-range negotiating code at the request of an Arabic - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin raised a storm in social media when he found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have access to an Israeli long-range negotiation code, which was justified by Arab clients.
Captain Lancman, director of the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman attempted to find Israel's long-distance negotiating code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, the country was not included in the list of countries that could be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that Israel has been wiped out and destroyed in Berlin, the new German capital, in 2016?
Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers a call to the country via its call centre.
The officer asked for clarification from the hotel's staff.
Lancman writes that the answer received "shocked him."
The Hotel administrator explained that "this is an intentional decision by the hotel's management."
The reason for the removal of the code was even more infuriated by the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the removal of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted an explanation from a hotel worker.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsmans, had called the case 'a great shame'.
We are surprised and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that it is in Germany that it is precisely in this hotel network that there is even more humiliation.
Explanation is not necessary.
The official said: "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also attracted quite a lot of attention on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has just had an Arabic customer.
Another newspaper said "shame" that the hotel was on the Kurfurstendamm street next to synagogai.
Der Spiegel said the hotel itself quickly rejected all accusations, saying it was "misunderstandings" and apologised to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung cites Kempinski.
And to add that the code was again added to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas to protest Brazilian students.
Students and police clashes took place in São Paulo, Brazil, Thursday, where students rallied against government education reforms.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to students.
The problems began when the law enforcement officers tried to extinguish the students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The proposal by Sanpaula Governor Geraldo Alckmina envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators signalled their graffiti with messages to provisional president Michael Temeru.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to support suspended President Dilmai Rousefai, whose commentator was voted by the Senate.
Scottish Kelke Skiners first to be in the UK for cycling of gold medals
The British team secured the title of the 2012 London Player of the World Cup, which was the first men to take their bicycle in Rio last night.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in the race, making Seru Krisu Holy proud of the legendary school and ending the winner for favourites New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Holly won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated this during the London World Cup, even though Holy had already finished his sporting career.
The problems were at the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics because of the need to replace the experienced start specialist James Stafu.
They managed to do so at the last minute.
When he left, his place was filled by Kian Emadi and Met Krampton.
The British trainers had hopes of the Skiner, seeing his potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenny, a champion with Holy and Skiner four years ago to set the record for the Olympics, but the start of the race was better for New Zealand.
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindes had close clothes after his circle, Kenny led the way and Skiners secured the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindu was driving more in order to allow Kenya and Skiner in particular to travel more quickly.
Holy watched the match as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinera, Kenya and Hindex's eyes when they went on to the podium.
The 23-year-old glass said: 'It was an unbearable honour'.
I do everything to defend my name.
In the final, we set the Olympic record and won World Championships.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Holly at the 2012 London Olympics, Hindes knew he had gone down deliberately on the trail after the unsuccessful start.
Later he defeated the comment and the British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
This time, however, there were no such incidents.
Hindes said: "The British flags were remembered in the tribes of London."
Over the last 3 months we have become a cohesive team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will be in the race for a country that won seven of ten gold medals on bicycles in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team-progress indicator in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Taking into account the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat Holy's success in acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medal; moreover, Kenya was born on 23 March (it looks like a sacred day for the British, because Stans Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Roger Banisters were born on that day).
Holy was born on that day.
Kenya's next matches are a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bothon said, "I just enjoy all of this at the moment.
The command trip is always the best.
Because you can win with the team.
Quite honestly, it's a little lonely to win. "
Hindes said, 'If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed as a weapon'.
That was the only battle for the medals on that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Briton Vigin, Ed Klensij, Steve Burk and Ovein Douls showed the fastest time to qualify for four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World record, which was set up in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and finals will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be the focus.
Yesterday, before his qualification trip, he had disagreements with the comariate when he was summoned by judges to measure his growth.
The women's trip will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Šanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Archibalda set a new record time for 4: 13.260 from Milngava.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will fight medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio as well.
In the meantime, the technical director, Mr Shein Saton, has resigned in different backmatches, after accusations of sexism and insulting dignity, and Holiness and Viktoria Bendleton are also closing their career.
But at the beginning of the race, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland rubber is not clear, because an ambitious agreement has been terminated.
The Aluminium rubble and the future of hundreds of its employees in Portland have become uncertain in Viktoria, as its main customer, the energy company, has announced that it will cease cooperation.
This statement is based on the plans of the government of Viktoria to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital to enable the company to continue its work.
Subsidies that have lasted for 20 years will be suspended in November.
This puts more than 2 000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant at risk.
Up to 2 000 direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the rubber consumes about 10 per cent of all Victor toria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry rubber, which led to the decommissioning of the Angleseas power plant.
The Portland rubber works for losses and can be closed.
These events have been the result of several years of speculation over the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The energy supplier of the plant, AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes in Ieleja, says that the other three will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most of the power stations belong to the Alcoa and Alumia joint companies, besides the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp companies.
"AGL" looks forward to continuing the operations of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply for the grid, "the spokesman said.
AGL said contracts were so-called "risk-restrictive contracts," which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month period of validity, and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL" also plans to receive revenue from these contracts in the 2017 fiscal year, "the company's representative said.
From the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that it has already included $187 million in losses in its forecasts, with these contracts going to be terminated.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate contracts would not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating or supply energy.
The company said it had signed a contract with Loy Yang for a 20-year period in 2010, but it will be interrupted in November.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland rubber in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the sector's weak economy.
Steven Mikelson, CEO of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate that 600 megavatus and Tomago 900 megavatus are using energy in Portland during the year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, then energy demand would fall considerably.
And that would not be a good thing at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
The demand for more than 160 000 people is rejected every year, and the situation could deteriorate as the budget falls.
Three out of five people in Wine-land - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal evictions - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that as funding falls, the situation will only get worse.
As from June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have done so far.
James Farels, director of the Catholic Legal Centre, said the latest National Legal Centre's Association report said legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people in need.
Mistry Farels said that if this decision is not lifted, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: 'The Wine-land Legal Centre is constantly underfunded, which means that aid is being denied to thousands of people in need'.
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debt, families experiencing divorce, workers unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more people in Capelland will have to deal with their difficult legal problems without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandisu to immediately stop cutting funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the country's average level.
Now it is time to also focus on the needs of local communities and their clients and the Palazčuka government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign has been sued because a firearm has been dragged off by a person.
New York: Donalda Trump's campaign organisers have been sued because they have not acted, having been informed that their North Carolina chief opened a firearm against a worker when they had travelled in one car in February.
This incident was described in a court case brought on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaigner, at the Shart Court.
Bordini said he had been waiting months for an internal review of the case, but understood that this would not happen.
Leader Mike Filip "pulled the pistol, put his fine finger on the light and opened a barrel against the completion of the Krist's knee," Bordini says in his complaint.
He also claims that by complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was lodged, the Republican presidential candidate led to a scandal stating to people that 'the people of Amendment 2', i.e. the owners and enthusiasm of weapons, could act if his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges were to win the election.
Trump's campaign said the media had broken his name from context and never incited any violence.
Bordini wants to claim compensation from the campaign's organisers for negligent supervision and from the Philippines for the attack, the illegal use of the weapon and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's spokesperson, Houpa Hicsa, did not comment straight away.
There has been a failure to communicate with the Philippines.
WCCB, local news agency Shart said the Philippines had recently left the campaign.
Nor has it been possible to call his consultancy 'Innovation Services'.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition: a landmark and a sports festival in Ceuta.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered for the floor and for the celebrations of sport in Ceuta.
After a decade of celebration, it was decided this time that the Christmas season would no longer exist.
A new page is now open.
The day started with sporting competitions.
This time the competition was not traditional and far too serious because, for example, horrors had to be thrown into a sleeping target, a booking flight, a game with a man's left hand, 'bumbuying' had not been at all at the Olympic Games.
However, every participant was able to show how strong, courageous, successful and attachable he is.
After the sporting Games, everyone gathered an open-air eat where the carpet began.
In the meantime, there was also a 'child corner' where the small had been able to swallow into the wreck and gain a new image in the bathroom.
A new feature, which could also become a tradition, was a driving gear in which both tractors and motorcycles travelled.
Everyone spoke to Inga Kadiķe-Skadina, head of the central administration of Schuman, who ordered a nice rest and dry time, the rain was raining but it could not do much to disturb.
The winds continued to greet the youngest inhabitants of Schuman.
Indeed, it is good that five girls and one foam have been added to the cold.
The crowds were performed by amateur arts class from Engures novade with performances - the performances of the year-old "Rudens ritmi," "Redas" performers of different peoples and the "Golden Shoe" of young people.
And the fact that the wet scene was also sidelined somewhere.
Of course, the famous actor duo Janis Jarans and Dainis Porgants, who were again Milan Nabiņa and Clerier Krane, as well as the attractive wife of Berzvila from the fishermen's sitting 'Day', were given to the local people and villages.
The ball was played by the Brugeus group.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we put a tremendous effort into benefiting all the country's regions from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Istall won an awful lot from the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be prepared for the Olympics and that it would be a worldwide failure.
The spectators were wrong for 2012, and in Heathrow they would not be right either.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
There is an excellent team working in Heathrow, which has created an investment programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure, with a time horizon and budget ranging from a terminal of 5 years, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years from the ground, to a terminal of 2 built between two more intensively used runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be financed with private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics was a great success, and I am sure that will be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment of which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Heathrow Management Board and former Secretary for Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman sits on the big road in an attempt to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, we were on the big road.
Police are trying to find witnesses in an accident when she was crossing several cars early on Thursday in the morning.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the Vo Canton city of Morges.
A Vo Cantons police report says that desperately wanting to commit suicide, a woman was studying on the road in the dark, where several cars drove her.
Obviously, in an attempt to kill yourself, the victim, the 49 year-old ushers, and several cars, including the heavy machinery, drove.
She died on the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, while others have not yet been identified, police said, calling on the drivers and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched in the case, which is a logical step in this case, a lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: "This will be explained by the Public Prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have taken place over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, a pedestrian was on a motorway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not be expected to be a pedestrian in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was justified in killing after she travelled to a man in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijernes in August 2014.
The Court found that the 22-year-old victim had drunk and had subsequently noticed to sleep on the road.
The Court concluded that a police officer who was on the road to the accident travelled in an appropriate manner and that the judge found that the man on the road was "a completely unforeseeable and exceptional case."
Anyone with information on the accident near Morges on Thursday is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are being collected on the Internet for a new competition for the Revenue Service's head.
The petition portal Avaaz.org launched a collection of signatures for a new Head of the State Revenue Service (SRS) competition.
A petition addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (Greens / Farmers) said the company wants a transparent and professional nomination process.
The petition was created on August 10 and is now signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating the Revenue Service's general director Ingas Kolegova is intransparent and unprofessional.
It recalls the best functional tradition of the Soviet Union.
This undermines public administration and once again leads society to disappoint governments and politicians.
"We need a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," the petition says.
Mr Janis said that the public is not aware of the criteria for the appointment of Kolegova.
Nor is it clear what the candidates are for the Revenue Service.
The petition states that the State Chancellery must form a new open competition, which will actively address professional candidates, attract personnel selection and offer appropriate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova for the Revenue Service's head last week, but all Unity ministers voted against, so the issue was postponed for the week.
Samoilovs: If we lost, then I played badly.
Zeng Samoilovs and Janis Schnins were hoping for the award at the Rio Olympics, but there is no difference in where to finish the race after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's strongest voleyball couples lost to Brazilians Evandra Gonsalwell Oliveira and Pedra Solbergam Salgade in a final and decisive match on Thursday.
In three games, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the ratio was the same for two other couples.
The three-point ratio, which was the least favourable to the Latvian duel after the solid loss, was counted.
"We were in the lead in the first six, but we've had 16 points from 16: 15," Smedins said.
I do not even know how we were left out of the remaining part of the sixth.
It cannot play it.
Then, in the second set, everything was in order and on the face we managed to break the game, and it should have been a good basis for the third set.
We started it in the same way, but after we changed the parties the result was only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group, all the teams were similar, with almost all the matches having three six matches, so the small points were important.
"We ought to play a bit more like that, rather than giving 3-4 points in a row," he said.
We knew that he could be canned.
"We've had 1-2 points in the first half of the season, and the third with + 4 he had a game," Smedins said.
We tried to show the best game.
They came in at times, they did not.
I did not see the overall picture before the massacre, but it was known that as many small points as possible had to be taken.
"If we lost, so I played badly," Samoilovs said.
We looked for a good Serb from Evanders and ended it quite well in the first six, but the third was open to him and it was difficult to form an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes at the Pedra serves in particular, but it has had to be dealt with.
Samoilovs said that, in contrast to the previous match today, athletes had no nervousness.
"We play, we played, there was protection, but there needed to be a better reception," the athlete said.
"They played well and they got to the Uurra in the end."
Before the tournament we said straight away that the lottery was the most inconvenient that could have been.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for the medals, and we do n't have the difference - 25, or the fourth," Samoilovs said, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilovs, who played for the third Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, was starting with Maris Pelevator and playing with Ruslanu Sorokin four years ago in London.
On the other hand, Shadman was the second start of the Olympic Games.
The Latvian energo follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvijas energo follows the process of opening up the gas market, both from the consumer and also from the potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the company's spokesman.
"The decision as to whether Latvia energo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by the gas market model and the regulatory framework that will be established."
"For our part, therefore, we are actively involved in the drafting and commentary of the legislation, and we are presenting our proposals," said Bidere.
According to BNS, the Economics Ministry, in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the Latvian Gas company, has developed draft Cabinet of Ministers' rules on trade in natural gas and use, which will change existing principles for the functioning of the natural gas market, giving natural gas customers the right to freely choose their natural gas dealer as of April 3 next 2017.
In its work on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the objective is to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the "central model of the trader," chosen as the most efficient and user-friendly servicing solution, where all customer servicing activities are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one point of provision of information and customer service, leaving the technical aspects of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We recall that household customers will be able to continue to receive natural gas from their existing trader at a regulated price after April 3, 2017, which will not be willing to choose another natural gas trader.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
On the other hand, economic operators will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Pending the conclusion of a natural gas trade agreement, a certain period of time will be granted to natural gas traders by the current natural gas trader at a certain price.
The draft Cabinet of Ministers rules define in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, the system operator and users.
The rules shall specify the procedures for supplying and interrupting supply of natural gas to users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of a gas facility, the procedures for settling services received, the level of interest for late payment, traders "switching arrangements, and the supply of customers in the event of disruptions to the supply of natural gas, the public trader.

Minister: Next week, the Revenue Service's Director General's salary is to be increased.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers) plans next week to talk to Prime Minister Maris Kucinski (Greens / Farmers) and government coalition partners about increasing the remuneration of the State Revenue Service's Director General.
Reizniece-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the Revenue Service's Director General's remuneration needs to be urgently addressed in order to make it more attractive to potential candidates for a re-run competition.
Next week we will also be talking about changing the conditions of the competition.
She also stressed that she did not have any idea of a particular candidate to address her vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola said that Inga Kolegova, the head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good director general of the Revenue Service.
On the other hand, as regards current Revenue Service chief chief Daci Peleka, who said he was ready to stand for the post, the minister reiterated that the new Revenue Service Director-General should be "sidelined" and should not come from the Revenue Service's structure.
She also emphasized that Saeima is waiting for the return of the leave to steer as soon as possible the amendments to the laws needed to reorganise the Revenue Service.
According to BNS, Inga Kolegova, head of the State Environmental Service, Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai (Greens / Farmers), has submitted an application withdrawing his candidacy for the post of director-general of the Revenue Service.
In her application, she said that this was not an easy choice, but over the last two weeks her relatives have been under serious emotional pressure, despite the fact that there has been no law-abiding action.
She also said that her candidacy had increased tensions between the ruling coalition parties, which was not acceptable.
Inara Petersone, the previous head of the Revenue Service, was also reported to be leaving office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchanges in the US and Europe and the value of the US dollar are increasing.
Worldwide oil prices are continuing to rise on Friday morning, with a positive impact on investor sentiments by the Saudi Minister for oil, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing countries will take action at the September OPEC meeting to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indexes reached a record high level on Thursday, which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
A rise in oil prices and a strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also led to a rise in Europe's stock exchange indexes.
The US dollar increased on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In September, the price of crude oil for supplies rose by $1.78 to $43.49 a barrel in the New York stock exchange.
The price of crude oil for supplies rose by $1.99 on the London stock exchange in October to $46.04 a barrel.
The Latvian canning manufacturer's' Blue salmon 'turnover drops by 33. 8% last year.
The Latvian canning manufacturer's' Blue salmon 'turnover last year was EUR 4.202 million, which is 33. 8% less than the year before, while the company's losses decreased by EUR 5.7 to EUR 904,7 000, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
According to the company's management report, in 2015, the company was dealing with losses caused by several reasons, including a persistent lack of working funds caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, ending a pre-existing credit line and leaving the Blue lagoon with contracts without the possibility of fulfilling them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to buy large quantities of cheaper raw materials and to obtain discounts.
The withdrawal of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU structural fund support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Likewise, the company's financial producers in the late year were negatively affected by the rise in the prices of raw materials and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the company's products.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers admitted price changes and were ready to purchase goods at the highest new prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, Zille lagoon opened discussions with potential investors, including valuation of the company's movable and immovable assets.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have seen and negotiated possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan covered the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, allowing for greater production productivity and capacity.
"Several installations were bought, which provide a higher rate of production," the company's management said.
Zillagona's management notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to meet orders that were not possible so far.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As there are already signed declarations of intent on the sale of a product, all produced will be sold in accordance with the declarations of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 000 euros a month, "the company's management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
Zillagona has sent its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded its sales to Cyprus and signed a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States in September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Zillagona worked with EUR 6.347 million in turnover and EUR 5.113 million in losses.
Blue salmon was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of EUR 1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private individuals, Mikhail Kaidanovam (89. 11%) and Igor Širšone (10. 89%).
Welcome to the 15th round of the museum to welcome the film's soul Zars Leanderi and take part in a press conference.
Riga can be seen as an inspiration for the start-up and inspiring city of God's Film Film, Saar Leanderes.
The anxiety of Zar Leures at the crowd of Cross Rwantas, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was beset in Riga in 1924, as she revealed the unusual low contest to the woman of Zar Leanderes who had been debited to the Riga City Cabinet's theatre.
Perhaps it was by chance that the nightmare in Riga became a fatal turning point on the Kar's creative path towards the world's glory.
Riga Leandela was associated with warm memories and was hoping to come to Riga in the visitors' gallery, but unfortunately these expectations had not been met due to the start of the Second World War.
Using the form of the show, the meeting will be possible at Riga festival in 2016 and the excellent King Leanderes will play the role of Ambassador Kerry.
The Aglona area is characterised by extensive traffic restrictions.
In order to ensure the safety of hosting festivals of the most sacrosanct Municipality of Marie Debese, from 12 August, from 17: 00 to 15 August, the transit of trucks on several roads along the country's roads in the Aglona area will be closed, the State roads of VAS were informed.
These restrictions will not apply to Aglona festivals and public transport.
It should be noted that construction works and construction sites at Aglona sites will only be able to pass through public transport and pedestrians during the P62 Krslav-Prevy-Madona section (0,80-4,00km) of the motorway.
Other road users will be able to travel by road, a scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants are arriving on these festivals, including pilgrims.
Drivers must therefore be particularly careful, as the movement of pedestrians along the different road routes to Aglona will be intense.
We call on drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions that have been introduced, to respect the organisation of traffic and to take account of the longer time they have spent.

Two children have been sexually assaulted in a leisure park in England.
Berkshire police in England are looking for an aggressor who sexually used two six-year-old girls in the leisure park Legoland, according to Daily Mail.
Police have asked parents to study the photographs taken in the amusement park, as they might be seen by an aggressor.
Girls have told the parents of what happened.
The man was a girl who was unfamiliar, white skin colours and some 20 years old.
Kurdish activists occupy the German public broadcaster's building.
A group of 30 Kurds took part in the WDR building in Düsseldorf on Thursday evening, where a protest was held for almost two hours, German police said.
The demonstrators who came with their posters scanned various slogans in an attempt to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
The officials said the demonstration was largely peaceful and protesters finally left the building voluntarily at the request of the workers.
The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers of cancelled flights at the airport on Wednesday.
If the insurance was paid out to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga airport on Wednesday 10 August, which led to the resignation of the planned music festival.
On 11 August, a customer received an application for compensation in case of insurance.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since flights cancelled at the airport on Wednesday made it impossible to do so, the consumer was reimbursed for the accommodation booking which could not have been cancelled, as well as for the festival's tickets of EUR 204.
On the other hand, the airline has promised consumers the money spent on air tickets.
On average, 15% of all travel insurance benefits have been compensated for the interruption or cancellation of the trip.
"These costs are reimbursed for the purchase, refund or exchange of tickets, as well as for the accommodation bookings," said Dagnie Rutka, head of the insurance product.
As we know, on 10 August a private plane stopped at Riga airport due to technical problems, so only a number of departing flights had been cancelled and several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
As a result of the Catholic renovation, a man is being forced to leave the ceiling and forced to leave his homes.
Dmitry Saidjaviv, a neighbour of the city, has been crying out from the ceiling and is not sure to stay in the apartment, said LTV's 4th student.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and in my apartment the ceiling has been broken.
Then I informed the Riga Building Board, the House Manager and other organisations.
The Board of Governors said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any expertise.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert," said Dmitry.
The guest expert arrived, quantified what happened and said the cover was unsatisfactory.
However, a month has passed on the building board since the first application by Dmitry, and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether a apartment is life-threatening.
In the Construction Board, it is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to Riga City Council, but they handed over to the house manager, then the house manager on the building board again and then there is a stalemate," said Dmitry.
After looking at the whole piece of paper, it is clear that construction has been stopped, even though it can be seen from time to time that someone is working there.
In the next two months, the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out repairs, has had to deal with the defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the Governing Board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this non-soluble construction is affected, so it is not certain that the subsistence owner is being put at risk.
"That's why we have asked for further clarification from this expert," Ilze Zūka, spokeswoman for the Riga City Council, said.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs at the upper apartment, construction is still being heard from there.
The penalty for unauthorized construction amounts to between EUR 70 and 700, but in the case in question the penalty may be much more severe.
While an expert opinion is awaited, the construction board has decided that both apartments should not be exploited, both those in which construction works are being carried out and Dmitry apartments.
"This is an unprecedented case in the works council's practice where, in this way, citizens may not only be exposed to their property, but also to the ownership of the property, as a result of a lack of knowledge or simply of reluctance," the board spokeswoman said.
Dmitry is now being forced to look for another place to live - to be a friend, a friend, a hotel or rent another flat.
But Dmitry can try to recover the damage from a neighbour through civil law, which can take a great deal of time.
As a result of the arbitrary construction of the two apartments, it is currently forbidden until the civil engineers have their conclusion, and this can be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment where the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened with prison sentences of up to six months due to a failure to take account of what the construction board said.
Come on.
How many fields are there?
The right answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white fields were born in the Demidova zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and sometimes they are blamed on the common, despite the fact that the common young are fed.
The transformation of the former PRTR into five stars will cost €22 million in hotels.
Gita Želve, spokesman of the future hotel manager Park Hotel Kemeri, will pay EUR 22 million to replace Park Hotel Kemeri hotel, the former prime minister, told LETA.
The construction of the hotel is the first stage in the reconstruction of the former PRC sanction.
The second phase will be "wellness," a glass clinic which is due to be discovered in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to be opened in May 2018.
He said the costs of the crash were unknown at the moment.
However, she points out that it will be located in a polylical building of the former resort of the PRC, which has an area of around 12 000 square metres.
The line will be located in three steppeds.
Park Hotel Kemeri and the intended clinical owner are the International Fund, G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors contributing money to the fund, said Želve.
As George Jouns, Executive Director of G Capital Europe, said earlier, investment of between EUR 12 and EUR 15 million in the former resort policnet, totalling more than EUR 30 million in investment.
As reported, over 42 hectares of historic park recovery, rehabilitation of bypasses and streets, construction of an interactive site for natural tourism, installation of the site and construction of parking facilities in the Emye Tasty Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the Jurmala City and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jurmala City Council intends to mobilise EUR 14.5 million from EU funds, co-financed by three EUR 4 million.
Design works will start by mid-2017, but construction works and clean-up work will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported, Park Hotel Kemeri and wellness are planning to build a five-star hotel at the Kemeri Palace complex.
However, the reconstruction lasted.
The report in 2010 also claimed that Ominasis was regularly contacted by Kempinski, the hotel operator, which continues to ensure day-to-day technical control in the Kemeri sanction, and would certainly have completed the renovation of the future hotel KPRi emeri in 2011 and immediately embarked on preparations to open the Kempinski hotel.
Park Hotel Kemeri auctioned the property of the solvent Ominasis Latvia in October 2014. Park Hotel Kemeri confirmed his readiness to purchase the property of the solvent Ominasis Latvia, but one month later the auction was found to have failed because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due course.
The sale price was set in line with the initial price of the last unused auction, which was €2.86 million.
As LETA was informed by city council spokeswoman Ieva Aile, the local government, by signing the protocol, has confirmed that the infrastructure that will be channelled through cofinancing of the EU structural funds will reconstruct the historic King Park, create an interactive natural tourism site, join roads and car parks.
The president will present the Order of Three Stars to Antoenka.
President Raimonds Vejonis will present the Thrace III class of the Stars Order next week, according to the president's agenda.
Award ceremony for the three stars will take place in the Black Rhine House at 13: 00.
According to information from Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antoins in 1998 graduated from Latvia's Latvian National Opera and Ballet College of the Music of Latvia, studying crowd games and acquiring singer at Margarita Grwis.
Describe to the Academy of Latvian Music Academy of Latvia, Arvoud Lustes.
The Latvian National Opera Cork was launched in 1997 and has been defeated by Oberto's role in the Opera Alchina operation in 1998.

In 2011, Antoov gave the title of "Otello" at the Paris Opera Operation, Kovengarden's opera in the youth studies of Luidos Apmeta, and in Stockholm, Kristofa Loja, who was studied in the West.
One year later, Antoine wrote the role of Otello in the Operation of London Coventen.
Former NATO commander Ban Ki-moon missed an email from the Russian hackers.
Hakeri, who hacked DNC's computers, may have carried out a number of other cyber attacks, also missed an email from NATO's former commander, Filipa Brief, and the Open Society of the George Soros Institute's "Bloomberg," a business news agency said Thursday.
The information obtained by Hakeri has been published on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, the Briefing correspondence and news of the work of the Soros Institute are also included.
For Hakers, the Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to the Bloomberg news, these cyber attacks have been carried out by the same hake hackers in Russian special services who have broken DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the breaking down of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to prosecute Russian or Russian hackers in an official cyber attack on the servers of the Democratic Party.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website released around 20,000 emails from the DNC computer system in July, saying that Democratic party leaders tried to undermine the campaign by former rival Vermont Senator Burnia Sandersa, a former Republican candidate of Hillary Clinton.
According to US press sources, the Federal Office of Inquiry, which is conducting an investigation into the breaking up of Democratic Serbs, as well as other US special services, consider Russia's involvement in the cyber attack to be almost indisputable.
Makartnie: Joko Ono was threatened by The Beatles.
Paul McArtny said that the presence of Joko Ono had created a feeling of danger from the legitimate group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old handstar is currently maintaining a "good" relationship with the widows of the late John Lenon, but she was frightened by the group when she was visiting the entrance to the studio, as Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo St, Lenon and Macarthia.
When asked the singer about relations between the two, he replied to Rolling Stone's magazine: "That is really good."
We were in danger at that time.
While we wrote, she sat on the accelerators.
Most groups could not tolerate this.
We were able to do so, but not very successful, because we were very tense.
We were not sex, but girls did not usually come to an enrolment, they allowed us to work.
When John started to meet Joko, she did not sit in the checkroom but in the four of us.
The author of Yellow Submarine admitted that he is now in regular contact with the former member of the group, Ringo, and that the record studio Apple's work plans are confirmed from time to time, but otherwise the Beatles have "ceased to operate."
Asked if he met with the other other remaining member of the legitimate rock group, McArtny told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often no."
We meet in social measures and prizes.
However, I do not have meetings, I feel somewhat dissociated from it.
I went from Apple during a difficult divorce.
I sent Jon Istard and said in my place: 'I am left with what everyone says, because I cannot tolerate sitting around the table'.
It was too painful as if we could see our domestic animal dead.
The company is now working in such a way that I will only listen to all the entries.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venera was once an inhabitable planet
On the basis of the latest climate models in NASA, Venera has once been an inhabitable planet.
The NASA Godarda Space Research Institute scientists have developed a model to explore Venice's history using tools and algorithms as climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venice, whose surface is warm, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon in the past in conditions similar to the Earth.
Scientists have already mentioned in the past that the slow pace of Venice's return is attributable to a dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venice once had a plan, a climate similar to the Earth and turned slowly.
The Model also looks at Venera's former topography.
There have been more droughts on the planet than on the Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity to make life possible and prevent the evaporation of water.
In the early days of Venice, Saule was 30 per cent brighter.
In the GISS model simulation, the Venera Return Model reveals that the daylight lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio told a press release.
This process gives rise to the surface of the warm planet and creates something that, in turn, forms part of a thick cloud that acts as a umbrella, shielding the planet from the Solar heat.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The model portrays Venice's history, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once inhabitable, Venera has been subject to too much heat and ultraviolet power over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and the shrimp was burned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water escaped completely, only the carbon dioxide atmosphere of the plan with the deadly greenhouse gas - Venera, as we know it today - remained above the plan.
Scientists published the results of the new Venera climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrik Roy resigns as an "Avalanche coach."
On Thursday, Colorado's Avalanche coach and hockey vice-president Patrick Roy made a plea, citing the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President and CEO Joe Sakiks confirmed this message and said the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years I have been performing my duties vigorously, passionately and ambitiously as head coach and vice-president of the hockey operations of the Colorado club," Roy said in a statement.
During this summer, I have much thought how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the bright it needs and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the vice-president of the main coache and the hockey operations must coincide fully with the vision of the organisation.
He should also have the possibility to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions have not been met.
The time that hired Roy on 23 May 2013 thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
It was said that Patriks informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him well in the future.
In his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014 Roy was recognised as the best coach for the league and received the Jekka Adamsa Award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Prix, but won the first round of the season in Colorado.
Avalanche closed the 2015-2016 season with a 39-39-4 result and remained behind the Wild team, failing to win the second edition of the Western Conference's organisers.
Roy won four Stanley Cup in his career, two with Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
The workers of the North Sea oil platform are resuming negotiations and postponing strikes.
Workers' strike over the wages of workers from the North Sea oil platforms has been postponed, as talks have resumed between the two parties to the dispute, state negotiators said.
Periodically, the Wood Group is striking on North Sea oil platforms where Royal Dutch Shell is operating.
The joint statement said that Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
A number of full days meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, with the aim of revising the issues at stake.
The trade unions said their recent events, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were counterproductive to the planned 30 percent salary cut.
This year, the Wood Group reduced the salaries of North Sea workers by 9 per cent due to adverse market pressure.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the salaries of road workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downward spiral.
Shell, on the other hand, has already cut wages for several thousand people and announced plans to suspend oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in the run-up to a large-scale merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MEP David Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion, compared to $7 billion invested over the last five years.
A plate-sized stars "return rate in the Plesse star.
The latest Cape Town Telescopic mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of the stars' return speed in the Street Street.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in this stars turn at different speeds, and how the stars' return rate can be linked to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the link between the masses of stars, the age and even the history of the solar system," World Caltech Infrasarch Processa and Analytical Centre scientist Luisa Rebula said in a news release.
The spanning star is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this stark are only starting to grow, reaching approximately 125 million years of age.
They are turning at maximum speed.
Looking at the maximum speed, these growing stars emit a lot of stars.
When they reach the magnetic field of the stars, they shall brake the stars.
As the stars grow older, their rate of return is decreasing.
The caller measures the rate of return of each stars, identifying the time between the appearance of recognisable stars such as sun plantations.
The latest catalogue of the stars turning speed shows that larger stars turn more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebull compares stars with depressed stars, exhibits more fruit dancers more slowly than small fruit dancers.
Rebuls tells us that the 'white' of the Plejādu shows that the rotating items are slower and bigger, while the quicker routing objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the close proximity of the Plesse star, it serves as a great space laboratory, where the characteristics of stars can be compared with the rate of turning.
Rebuls tells us that the star of Plemise is helping to develop theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions, both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the stars are slowing down and the whole process of stopping them.
Rebull and his colleagues gave a detailed analysis of the speed of the Plesse stars' return in three new publications that will soon be published in the Journalist Astronomy.
