28-year-old boss in San Francisco Large
This week, a super-shop was found dead 28 years old, who recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim is saying that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to go across his brother, pointing out that 'His life finally started to improve'.
The captain, who was found on Wednesday at the Hospital super-shop, has been identified as a 28-year-old French Senate, a representative of the Office of the Department of Medical Medical Medical Certification.
The San Francisco Police stated that his death was recognised as murder and is currently under investigation.
"We're going to be in a dream in Boston," Sons & Daughters, Sons & Daughters San Francisco.
Restaurant Sons & Daughters spokesman told us that his death was shocked and shocked.
"We're a small team that works like a frozen family and we will miss him," he said.
In this difficult time, we are looking at the friends and family of the Frenchman.
Lugano Galicia tells us that at the beginning of the day he had been a nightmare in hosts, but in recent times life has finally improved.
"He died in a new apartment and met a girl," he said.
Luiss Galicia says that he did not know who would like to go across his younger brother.
He was a good man with a great heart.
"He always knew his family by preparing a corrosive edge and preparing a lunch," he said.
He never wanted to get involved in the dispute.
He was a brother that adapted to the others.
"Taking into account everything that has shot the world in the world, he was like a diamble diamant, who died on a daily basis," he says.
Anyone who has information on what happened has called for the SFPD Information telephone, 415-575-4444.
New outbreak for doctors: call for new protests
Representatives of young foreign doctors are demanding their trade unions to initiate protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) for the new Foreign Affairs Committee (JCESA) is preparing to request a board to support wider protests in early September.
The JAK is of the opinion that ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the LMA contract.
The Treaty voted for 58% of all the members taking part in the vote.
On Thursday evening, on Twitter, a member of the JUK Council, Ebadna Makcorts, points out that the government is continuing to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: 'As a result of this, the vote in the JUK has resulted in a complete rejection of the contract and the decision to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues'.
In response to the silence of the government, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to prepare for the preparation of new treaties to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors have taken part in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS in history.
After the vote rejecting the Treaty provisions of the LMA, which were recommended by the BPA, Dr. Johny Malawana, a new external representative of LMA, resigned LMA from his post.
Prior to meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had said BMA's members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary James said that the contract would be concluded with the medical mediators of England.
Russia and Turkey: Reinforced alliance?
A glance which ended up with the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce them and announce the eight-month word and the end of the economic sanctions war.
However, Vladimir Putin congratulated the Turkish leaders on St Petersburg, the impression that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However, both rounds.
Vladimir Putin looked at the rain and did not give a warm emotion, even given his customary reservation.
On the other hand, Erdogan Erdogan said at least five times when he described his "expensive friend," a briefing.
I felt the number.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would not only improve before the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
Next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan knew as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm gives rise to contradictory feelings.
But from Putin's nuclear test, the Russian leadership has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he referred to in his address was the exodus of the Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted sharply at that time.
Putin accused the Ankara to inspire a shame in the back of Moscow.
The realisation was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Updating true confidence will be very difficult, maybe impossible.
Russia's public position has changed since November.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive allegations against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed to be guilty.
The most serious of us was the accusation that the family of Erdogana himself has made profits from the smuggling of illegal oil through the Islamic State.
He did not, of course, deny it.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg summit is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting happened only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogana.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
The benefit of the Ankara from the peace reconciliation is obvious.
Firstly, Erdoganam needs all the possible friends following the failed coup last month in which he tried to overthrow him.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused great damage, in particular the ban on chafter flights, which normally provides a number of millions of Russian tourists in Turkish cannula every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
The Russian militators and the shellfish are also relieved in the hubs when regular flights will be restored.
They look forward to the holiday in the Mediterranean season.
Already this week, national TV provides for a fall in fruit and vegetable prices, as imports from Turkey fruit and vegetables will be restored.
I quote the local newspaper Holiness: 'Thurists for them, tomato us'.
However, the visit was also other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for, in their opinion, weak responses to the attempted coup.
It is also possible to note the frustration of the lengthy negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin's intervention, which is appalled by the situation of Turkey alienated from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly received complementary points in Ankara by expressing his support for the elected government following the attempted coup.
Please note that Moscow is well aware of this, because it is deeply rooted in fear of regime change in the country itself.
The summit, which took place in this gluble sea, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present themselves, as someone analyst, 'excluded alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite public demonstration, there are still considerable differences between the two countries.
The main disagreement affects Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peace media but, in fact, Russia and Turkey are in favour of the opposite side.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations without wishing to disclose the information, both presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President focused resolutely on the disagreement of both countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise this.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member Turkey seized a Russian Battalian plane, the situation has improved, because both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
Scotland's Royal Banka will no longer have access to customers outside Scotland
The inventory shall, in future, play a role in supporting the role of the bank, as notified by the Executive Director of the Bank.
Outside Scotland, the ICRC will no longer be available.
The BBC channel case in Scotland that the IRB brand was associated with the Bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because, eight years ago, the bank nearly bankrupted and required financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts from the note strategy have used the IRB brand to protect other consumers' financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds of international sports sponsors, starting with Six African regiment and finally, Vimbleton tennis player Chambre.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands to the fore.
Scotland's Caretaker Bank will be accessible to Scottish customers, but it will not be originated.
In England and Wales all the ICB references, outside the headquarters and the official exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands, such as Centts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also be taken into consideration.
The manoeuvre was interviewed during the journey with customers and staff by Inverb.
He told BBC Scottish's channel: "The IRB will become the brand of our investors and who work our workers because we are now becoming more than a brand bank."
The bank itself became a global brand and the ICB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in the sector and our workers will work with customers below these brands.
The ICC has already announced that it will not continue the sponsorship of the Seas Nations and involve various brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"It is high time to become a brand bank because we have been asking ourselves a question for a long time to become a better bank for our customers?" the Executive Director of the story.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would be a great bank for our customers and we will develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and concentrating on the needs of consumers and not for our own needs, we have obviously achieved a major change.
Once again, we can revive these brands, so I think that is now the right time.
Dean Governor wins 3000. by acquiring first place in Newcaseille with horses Predelection
The departments corrupt the charts, pulling their 3000th victory twice to finalise the first race in Newcast.
On Friday, the Winkespeople held his 3000th victory in Britain's history, taking the first place in Newcasele.
He achieved this by breaking down the second victory in those race, which took place in his home town, with the Predilection coached by John Prsden.
The Italians are the sixth catalogue of 45 years, who has reached a breakthrough in the races of the horse races.
He has joined Serie Gordon Ričardde, Dougam Pigota, Lester Pigota, Drink Ederia and Villius Karsons.
"This is something special."
I am very touched because my family is here.
I am very happy that it took place in Newcasian because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Karabitan Askota, but a normal Friday evening, combined with 20 000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
The Governors and the Daatrection are expected to be applause and light.
The two joints have reached this record straight with obstacles: the hijack of Rihards John Jonathan Jansons and career break by Sir Antonijs Makow, who has installed several records in his career, scrapping over 4300 victory.
Lester Pigung, winner of the winner, won 493 victory during her career.
The hearing is one of the most contemporary catchés in today and it is no surprise that he has achieved a success that is only able to achieve.
He is a powerful and powerful one, but his tactic feeling is separated from other chickens.
He is a fantastic phrase, she enthusiastically and harassed the harsh of fanatics for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epidem rainfall, I said to the Frenchman that he would have wiped up 6000 victory if you were not involved in just a week's murder and big races.
However, it is a real joy that a Frenchman has been operating on a regular basis in the UK race for 30 years.
He is a yardstick, which is excellent in the British race and he is an excellent hedge.
The French Desks noted that achievement with his firm's sign - the airlift of the flight.
From the finger at the wind of the wind up to an airlift tricks, the French Dessors have for twenty years been the face of the British horse races.
This has been a full road.
He has won a number of big races, including famous 1996 "Great Engineering" in Akin, and has also survived an aircraft crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in racing for some time - the executives in the past have said that he would be happy to continue joining in at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismisses Chief Executive of Administration, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpected an unexpected defect of the administration's director, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been behind him for many years in the immediate vicinity of the people.
Today, the 66-year-old politician has been appointed as Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement says Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the President of the Russian President," without giving any reason.
In the place of the Ivanova, I appointed Antonis Kaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
A diplomat has been issued for 44 years.
The landscape is born in 1972 in Tallinn, in Tallinn, absent a prestigious Moscow Department for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in Tokyo's embassy.
As a result of the Kremlin's homepage (Russian), later he chaired the Bureau's protocol and government staff management.
After the appointment, he said: "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the State when drawing up laws and controlling your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommending himself as his substitute.
Do smiles convince?
This step confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sand and close to Vladimir Putin's alliance and, like Putin, worked at the time of the Soviet security service.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the national television session, both husband said that Ivanov resign from office on his own initiative.
But despite the smallest smiles, rarely this explanation is persuaded, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows.
However, the official statement that the man who was seen as a mayor president suddenly wanted to become a Russian environment policy manager is treated with great scepticism.
"It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked me to entrust this difficult position, you could even say, problematic office, four years.
It turns out that I have been working in this office for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanovs took office in December 2011.
He was the prime minister and Minister for Defence previously.
He is a member of the Security Council of the Russian Security Council and a former national security service worker, like Putin.
At the end of 1990 Putin chaired the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of VDK, Ivanov took over his post.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov to five people who trust the most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was considered as a potential candidate for the Russian President because Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then the President became a different player in Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister and, after three and a half years, he returned to the post of President.
Dateway off in a garden town of Banfia
One husband from Banfas is asking for help to find out the conditions which species have appeared in their garden Banfti.
Kevin Hain thinks that 75 fish could be ridiculous by dirty spots.
Mr Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, released a catalogue of fish videos for Periscope, hoping that anyone could be aware of how these 5 centimetres of large fish caught up in his garden.
Cheese at the junction: the bridge is now connected to Faife.
A total of 1.35 billion polar projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Carsque Crop crossing and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faife.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, meaning that the building of the bridge is drawing to a close.
The structure of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
This consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
At present 1.35 billion polar projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The economic secretary, Keits Brauns, had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to put on the bridge.
He said: 'This is a symbolic and historic moment for the construction of a Cwine bridge.'
In this project, we are seeing an incredibly explosive engineering option where more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel are used in constructing this share.
Despite the huge weight of the bridge and the combination of sizes, bridges and vibrating, the combination of bridges and vibrating is an extremely delicate process requiring enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge had already been built and the final stage connecting the bridge to Rositu will be debated today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be included.
Master Martins, director of the fourth bridge connection project, said: "The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the engineering of top class engineering.
After the fitting of the last phase and connecting it to the north-tower, we were forced to connect the northern part of the road to the ground, or viaduke.
This was done by handing over 700 millimetres from the north to the south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, a very delicate operation.
It is huge, because the vibrUkraints are 222 metres long, weighing some 6000 tonnes and had to pay close to 3%.
The machine, because the pressure in both directions working in the team was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything was successful.
Simona Bailsa won gold forms for women.
There were tensions.
It is a matter of anxiety.
This is not a concern for Simmons Bailsu.
Dinnamic lenses.
Without sufficient effort, exercise is being taken to the bag.
Superfluous on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic Championships.
On Thursday 19 years, an American soldier won gold medals by totally demonstrating the difference between themselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
A total of 62,198 were head of the final court over the outcome of the silver medal and her team, the result of the results of the Basque Islame and bronze medals, Arena Mustament of the Russian Easter.
On Thursday the US sportsman Simona Bailsa made a vignette for the award of the Bhutto sports exercise in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for 2016.
Bailsa became the fourth American man in a row that won the till and the fifth best soldier by gradually strengthening the reputation as the best guarantor of his generation and possibly the best guarantor's history.
When the final result was announced, she turned out into sharp relief because the long way was at the end of the long road.
This achievement resembles him next to unfit sportspeople as Master Felps, who raised their sporting nature at another level.
It has dominated the last three years in the form of sport by acquiring 15 parts of the world's championships, including 10 gold medal, falling into such excellent, precise and ambitious combinations, saying that the 1984 Olympic champion called the "best guardian what she ever saw."
In Brazil, he was expecting a final test where she had to deal largely with the expectations of her, not with the other athletes.
She would disappoint if she returned to his home country in Springé, Texas without gold medals.
The US sports Simona Bailsa (left) and Alice Raissae are plundered following the battlesale of gold and silver medal in the 2004 summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
Bailsa won first gold medals on Tuesday, making a special sample co-ordinator at Marta Karolji Saturti.
Although Bailsa claims that in its long way, the wet surrogates had not waited anything about it, it is not true.
Part of her leisure's free movement, which includes her special acrotic transition, is accompanied by lats music, which would be perfectly fit for the streets along the Rio Olympics.
It is not coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and found to be found by the Timian Burch in exile on a sports screen, where the Burich Diagnosis took place, has now become the force to be taken into account.
She has not lost a multicultural race since summer 2013 and winning a series can continue as long as Bailts want it.
Even though, during the two rooms of Mustafin, it was only an illusion.
The weight of the buckle and free movement - the part of the competition, where Bailsa will defend its champion, is still ahead of us.
She set at the forefront of the outcome of 15.433 and reinforced leadership with a result of 15.933 free movement
Raissae asked him her little while she waited on the results, which were just formality and she turned a flash when he came to the dream that she had previously recorded in his record book.
The result of the Raissau was a slight revenge for four years of ancient events when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but he lost the battle for a bronze medal.
This time, the cemetery, which the Americans call a 'grandmother', were sounded by the Americans for 22 years.
She was able to dedicate air spectacle after the free movement which dispelled doubts about her return.
Meanwhile, for 19 years of old Bailt's virus on Twitter, the one she published this week is already completely different.
The six-year-old Mahaju Brauns live in the garden in Philadelphia.
Police said that 6 years old had been shocked in Philadelphia, pointing out that it is already the second six-year-old who shocked Filadelphia this week.
The CBS Filadelphian news channel confirmed that it was Mahajs Brauns.
Parents say that Brauns was shocked several times, including through the circus, in the wet, rock and coat, but still had the consciousness when he took to hospital.
His grandmother Damast Melendez tells TV: "His small body was simply a lovely paque."
I could not believe it.
A farmer in a critical position has been hospitalised and several operations have already passed.
The family is informed that he will certainly recover.
He had to start moving in the first class at local primary school.
Brauns is one of the four people in the town of Jermanta's town.
Three men were shocked: two 29 years old men and one 32 year-old man.
Chancellor Fischer Boel reported that one in 29 years of men is in a critical condition, while the situation of the other two victims is stable.
Canal says that a child was found in the front seat of the machinery along the 27-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police investigate whether anyone was attacked.
He told Chancellor CBS Philadelphia that several killers were most likely to have been involved in the shooting.
In the place of the visit, a weapon of cartridges belonging to various weapons has been found.
It seems that this has been a long-standing shake-up.
In both pedestrians, the chaplates were found.
"It seems to me that there have been several armed sharps that took an active part in the shooting," the captain Massidelphia Police master Antonijs Gintransi.
Hundreds of homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has yet been detained and reports are reported that the police check the recordings of the observation cameras.
On Tuesday, a 6-year-old girl was asleep during the firing while she scored her home in Westphalia.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the perpetrators.
Why do we need Simona, Gabon and Lauria?
I call it a year for a number of reasons for the memory of the Women's Olympic Vierlatlung.
Firstly, I have been on all summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three miles, Simona Bailsa, Gabi Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza, inspired by many young girls of young origin.
People can be proud that this team is also part of the Alliance RaisMane, which is a Jejiete and Meizona Kociana, which is a Catholic.
Finally, the team genuinely representative America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
The best guarantor of the last four years is the Americans of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabi took over points 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabija Duglasa became the Olympic champion and America could be raining.
The world has now seen unbelievable obstruction by the triple world champion of Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Lauria Hernandeza by means of unprecedented but hungry exercises.
On Thursday, he became the fourth American man in a row that has won gold medals for the individual's many women.
Her team acdrene Alija Raishee won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the rest of the country is completely different in the rest.
Hunt, Gabon and Laurium entered the Olympic coread in the same way as the Alliance and Meizona.
They are the "Olympic Quartet," because the next Olympic exercise team will only be four athletes, and this is the last year of the third anniversary of the Cluten Karoée.
In fact, exercise is expensive for sport; it is mostly trained in private households in the club, and they maintain the parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, forums, savers (coaches, sportsmen and their families) and other expenditure.
Most of these economist clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes plunge all their trainers and it is expensive and a long investment for easy families.
Eimija Burich - Simonian Baills and Megija Haini - has trained his sportspeople since the two girls seated with an easy quiral.
We need to provide young girls who inspire Simona, Galicia and Lauria, cheaper exercise exercises.
I founded my girl organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is in Hapleg, and we offer over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercises, free of charge or at a low price, and we have trained national and international champions as well.
In September, we will find a branch in Detroit (in my home town) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn this excellent type of sport.
Loblatly develops the coordination of power, localisation and body, as well as teach hard work, discipline and ambition to targets.
This combination guarantees a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in an easy electronic way and it is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
I thank Simona, Alija, Gabija un Meizona for the excellent demonstration of the 'Meter Force' through the extraction of gold medals and motivating numerous young people of different origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
The new doctors plan to develop more strikes after the rejection of the offer of Dgeremia Hanta.
Ministers expected an end to the disagreement by reaching agreement on the changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association, which was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37 000 new doctors involved in the vote.
In July, the Hent announced plans to conclude a contract saying that NHS is in a fragile state and further delays would only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new treaty, which provides for changes to the conditions for working night change and weekends in order to improve working conditions for non-standard working hours.
Last night in BMA, Dr. Enena Makourta said that new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that this would deepen the labour crisis and does not allow for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks have been postponed until the first new doctor will sign the new treaty, so progress needs to be made, because time is not enough.
The BPA effort to resolve the problem of the negotiations has faced a reluctance of the government and sometimes with total silence.
This has happened despite the fact that last month, James Hugher said that his doors were always open.
James Hanne has to take immediate action, stop nearby and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike at the end of April more than 13 000 square operations and 100 000 visits were suspended until peachers and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had gone in the haddove.
Ministers expected an end to the differences in agreeing to a treaty change agreement with the British Medical Association.
The BPA wants to raise the rate of 54 000 new doctors at the weekend to be covered by the new Treaties.
The executive director of NHS, Daniels Morioners, called for new cure to not go into strikes.
Mr Mortimera says that strikes do not solve anything, but only raise pressure on the busy workers and worry, create stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have discussed the new external committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about the lenders and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as the deployment of workers, flexible training, additional training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes and gender pay inequality in medicine shows that employers, England's health education institutions and the Ministry of Health seriously wish to implement the agreements concluded with BU in November, February and May.
Knowledge for 2 pounds per day may reduce the risk of heart.
Thousands of patients who have been heartened could be treated with a medicine for 2 pounds per day because the official representatives reclaim to use them for more people and longer.
In contravention medicines Ticagitor reduces the repeated risk to people with heart limbs.
These drugs are already being used for 12 months after their heart, by reducing the risk of repeated acts.
NHS is recommended to use this preparations for a period of 4 years after its heart, in order to further reduce the risk of cartridising to people with cardiovascular problems.
However, at the moment, NICE is currently in charge of using this preparation for 4 years after its heart, in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular cardiovascular.
Every year, some 140 000 people in England are undergoing a heart and a quarter of them are experiencing repeated heartlands or insults.
Sirleaf and insults lead to the accumulation of fatty substances in heart attacks by means of refreshments.
If the offensive comes to fire, it can cause thrombin by blocking blood streams and causing a heart attack.
If thrombin is separated from blood salts, it can become further in blood and block blood access for brain drain, causing infark.
People who have been very strange are exposed to a greater degree of reheartening.
Ticagitor, produced by a British firm AstraZeneca and traded by Brilique, reduces the risk of making thrombs.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagitor 12 months and another 3 years from 60 mg twice a day with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Director said: "Despite the availability of medicines for reheartying, more than a quarter of people who have been hearteous face yet another heart or an insult, often suffering severe consequences."
Fear from reheartune can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor combined with aspirits effectively reduces the risk of repeated heartrending and infarcerated risks for people who have already experienced it.
By recommending the treatment with the Ticagitor, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment options for thousands of people, which are thus beneficial.
In view of the limited information on Ticagitor efficiency and security, in particular the risk of assification using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines shall not recommend that it be used for longer than this deadline.
Media culture facilitates fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the steering report, a former Mayor of Economics, Lutans Rahmans, was dismissed as a result of corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness has brought about massive fraud in Muslim communities as a result of the culture of political correctness.
The former government minister, Sir College, criticises the police, the electoral supervisors and the city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "I fear ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to locate from election stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that the voters should show identity papers when they vote to prove their true identity.
Now only the name and address should be indicated by the voters.
He is even advised to mark the purchasing power of the ballot box with a special tiny in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs also need more protection, say Sir Ethics.
He believes that the press should provide more access to the Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent fraud elections but also to protect local authorities from more corruption and fraud cultures that go hand in hand with it'.
The report commissioned Dauningstrated following a scandal in relation to the poerhammer's urban elections.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to lift the mayor of the mayor of Lutkeu Rahman from the mayor of a mayor of rabbits and illegal activities.
The Court found Rhmans cynically marked the religious viewpoint of its Muslim community and silence its critics by denouncing racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahmans has led my election campaign with the accusation that the religious duty of religious Muslims is to vote in favour of her."
Some 300 votes were falsified or doubtful as one person voted several times.
Sir Eriks also indicates that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He went on to say that it is particularly disturbing to vote by a pack where the senior members of Muslim communities forced out others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Jonathan Sacks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the display of a supporting document to identify the identity of the person.
His report says: "Evidence suggests that members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the oldest selected candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is a fear that the bodies of the regions do not draw attention to these problems because of political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be affected."
Sir Ethics outlined 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, including a ban on political activists to operate with the votes cast in order to prevent "votes."
The report, which is being considered by the Terzaga Meja, also calls for a more thorough verification of registration in order to prevent the use of voter lists in the field of immigration and benefits.
To consider the possibility of requiring voters to produce a supporting document before the vote.
To mark the votes of the ballot box, with special tins, to avoid double voting.
Systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to make sure that a person has the right to vote.
I have three years to make any request for an automatic vote by post.
To deny political campaigners and activists working with votes cast by post and ballot boxes by post.
Providing police powers to organise guards at the polling stations.
Give a change to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons under threat of intimidation, in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Allow the photo to the polling stations.
To say a requirement to use only English (except in Wales) in polling stations.
Step up training to ensure polling staff ensure that voters proceed to ballot boxes by one.
Sir Ethics strongly criticises the Metropolitan Police, saying it did not understand that there were no accusations about the Ferhamleta case.
He tells: "The electoral court only captured Mr Lufé Rahman and his representative of the actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was certainly found guilty of a standard of evidence of criminal justice based on non-compliant evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient test of the city council's electorate in the ballot boxes.
Sir Jonathan Sacks says: "The decision taken last year is a wake-up call.
Our lands are known as the birth of the parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of the institutions that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.

The purchasers are shocked by a woman who is unshadowed in the middle of the top runners.
The gates were uncomfortable when a woman started to dress to kick up the bar.
It was even worse for him to see if she is standing and then went out and then put his bictts back on the shelves.
She continued to look for the Place of the clothing Folkeley Place in the shop in the shops and had a further four bicks.
Prince k Goverals Bouverie Place at the Place in the Place of Trade in Folkeston, the place where this woman went down and then put it back on the shelves.
At that time, two children were also found in the shop, Jane Deimedisone, who says that the unknown woman after the subjacking inflicted his clothes and left the shop without saying anything.
She says that people were not able to believe their eyes.
In the middle of the story, she took out of a floating sub-bicycle, pulled his barrees and bicks and went on to the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she simply drove on the ground.
Everybody looked out how she wouldn down the bictts and apparently the woman did not like them because she simply put them back on the shelves.
She knew three beet until she decided that she did not like any of them and left the shop.
It was not looking for him to worry that anyone would watch or think of a man who bought the clothes she cursed.
Dear from Kenya (33 years) from Kenya: "Derk's idea that someone bought the clothes who have been beaten by another man and who are then not washing."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
"I assume that a job after her filling took out the clothes from the gauge - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that we could buy a new premium and find out that one woman has had enough and then has not washed it.
Prince said he was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August.
Concrete clothes have been removed from the boat.
How to protect yourself from firearms by using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it somewhat safer.
In order to find out how to protect themselves in the near distance from the aggressors, we talked to Krav Maga's gift from New York Ronald Mizraki.
Whether you attach yourself to the front or the versa, this video shows how to protect themselves and gain the prevailing officer.
The mines point out if the attacker is attacked on the verge, then you must first come back to see the attacker and avoid this trajectory.
Then the weapon must be interlocked between his former hand and shoulder and a beacon in the face of his free elcony.
Then, followed by a circus, and while the attacker trail salt, withdraw him, pulled through the gun and retreat while continuing to take the weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar: avoiding this trajectory, a weapon must be shut down and so that the evil cannot be shocked.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and put a beat in the hands of the cream and finally deprives him of a weapon and relinquish his father on him.
Want to be difficult?
We look at the videos to see what Mizraki does.
But, if you do not have Krav Maga's lie, it is more secure to give the robber some money.
The family family destroys the social home of Saltts Cornvolas and is put on the street.
The family family has been laid out of the terror of neighbouring countries by causing damage to the social home for 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Ship Trebilkok were removed from the property Salta Cornvolla, as several complaints were submitted to them.
When they were forced out of property, the members of the Hosted Housing Service found that property was completely devalued.
Sharks and walls were beaten, the waste was wasted everywhere and walls were tied with graffiti.
The family is now out of property and is most likely to live in a private ownership.
Donna Makevoja, administrator of the Kornvolt Housing Service, says that there is a concern that housing will not be renewable.
She says that people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like this.
A number of factors need to be assessed in this case, as in the future, there will be no good repute in the Cornwall.
The family is famous and their word is well known.
The rest had three sons that were periodically occupied and the police say that their terror expressed themselves as violence, taking care of bearers, intimidation of local populations, drug use, drug sales and loud computing and layout.
In June 47, the oldest Selbase, whose name was property, sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
Several crushed houses found a waste of discarded chat.
In the case of drug trafficking, several floor boards have also been broken.
Neighbours say they have regularly beaten the streets and are constantly called the police.
The Kornvolas Housing Service issued them out of property forcefully when they had 11 weeks to get out of their homes on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbours were very happy about extermination because their lives were absolute.
One said: 'They don't care for other citizens'.
We lived them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
Incredibly, how often we have seen the police here.
We could not sleep this morning.
We wake up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally leaving, it will be wonderful here.
Adami Fitzpatrdom, who is the leader of the European Neighbourhood Protection Officer of the Cornvolas Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family here has lived for 20 years and the police are being called here regularly.
Various old and unusable objects were found in the houses of poultry.
He also said: 'It is a shame that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because putting the houses out of the houses is always the last step by the Kornvolas Housing Service. "
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and the neighbours had been very hard to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that has been invested in this case by all my teams, the Devon and Kornvolas police and members of the compatriots who were courageous and collaborated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzvodów said that all three sons have lived here in different periods of time, but everybody is about 20 years old.
There were no clean trees left on the floor in one of the room after the plate.
Professional workers will now have to meet the waste ccultivated in their mother.
In 2014, the police carried out searches and found more than 70 grams of marihuan, important, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
The Skille was only recognised as a responsible category B for the storage of drug-grade substances with a view to disseminating them.
She went on to say that the money was destined for her son in Los Steldonam, who died in a road accident in 2013.
After dispersal, it has become known that they are currently doing some private property in Plimits.
Many homes were hit by the graphics.
The police said they will continue to force tenants who break their rent contracts.
Professor Nikiñas, spokesman of the Devon and Kornvolas, said that this expulsion is an unequivocal warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She said, "This is a warning for those who believe they can behave as they want and have no effect."
The police and the Kronvolas police do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Broadcasting can give impetus to the economy.

Cannes's Mayors banned the burkings at beaches.
The Mayor of France's southern African town Cannes has banned the wetlands of this city, which almost fully covers women's bodies and is very reminiscent of the hydrochum, the local authorities announced on Thursday.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Liner, has signed the order that 'access to beaches and bathing is prohibited for anyone who has no bathing water that respects good customs and secularism' as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Downy spending that shows a great deal of religious denominations at a time when France and the cult are the target of terrorist attacks can provoke the risk of disturbance, collisions, etc.," said the order.
"We are talking not about a ban on religious symbols in the beach, but about outgoing clothes linked to the confidence of terrorist movements fighting for us," he said.
He added that the Cannes Fills were not seen in the Cannes Fills since 28 July, when the "Republican" spokesman Link signed the order and entered into force.
This week, an accomplices in Marseille was cancelled by a planned private measure Muslim women who would be wearing the bribblowers in the swing lines, because the indignation of this measure was expressed by both the right and the left.

On 26 July, two strikes who had given confidence in the Islamic State were brutally murdered in the church in the north-west of France.

In the Lucavée, the festival has begun a festival.
On Thursday, 11 August, a start of one of the last festivals of this summer featured in Luvvconsolidate - there will be a 'Cuba' until Sunday night.
On the first night, groups such as Enter Shikari from Britain, which were expected last year, but from the programme, NOFX, DJ Maxim from Group "The Prodigy" and others were missing from the programme.
In the next Festival Days, the programme has also noteworthy words: Guano Paes and Garbage, Pope Benzy Ramone's BlitzRussig, Lieuto & Lysais, Vopitch and a number of other but full operational programme could be seen here.
This is the second year in which the festival's' Kubana 'takes place in Latvia.
Last year this suffered a financial failure and huge damage, but it was not kept by the organisers, adding the "All Day Long" (Friday evening 19: 15 to 15) and said that the festival has become "nearest and obtained the local flask along with Riga symbols like its panorities and goats."
Whether this effort will be justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival has just come to note, but as the Delfi Observer observed in the first evening, at least there has been a huge number of people struggling and the number of visitors was similar to last year.

President, who remained on the eve: Gustavam Logalam - 145
On Friday 12 August, a total of 145 years was born, since the second Latvian President, Gustav Zemgale.
The Latvian state proclaimed the Low, but it is not earned by the widely described first Latvian President to be on the bag of Chakry and Monday's last sentence of President Columbus Ulmaa.
No one of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as a baby, a decade ago by Arnolds Auzzi, the Gustaden Lost.
Delfi Annan emphasized that the Earth is one of the rare earners of the top senior politicians who have had a humanitarian feeling.
The others are very delicate, always very right.
He teaches that at all, so this could be similar to what Raimonds Vejonis is like.
"He was close to the people," he said.
Modern politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Kārlis Ulman as good leaders, but rarely know how silly he was.
The only man on which he was denied was General Balodis.
Even if he is abhorrent and smile in the bills, he was hysterical after the man.
"Looking at the sense of humour and democracy leaves the opposite impression," he said.
Professor Aivars Stranga, a Fifth Forum of the University of Latvia and the philosophy of the philosophy of Latvia, agrees to Auzzi's assessment of the Earth's wet as a peaceful and tied statesman.
He also notes that the head of the Earth has raised the dignity of minorities, calling on the Jewish representatives to be regularly invited to President pill.
"In the meantime, it was not usual, after the head of the Low Territory, Alberta Kuzsis took over," the historian said.
He was a silent and balanced man who had long had to talk about president.
He did not seek the same, just an unbearable lady.
He was also quite critical as he did not know the French language but considered it to be understood by the President.
"In the course of the Presidency, the French language foundations were upheld," Strange explains.
The low you did not allow me to speak again, he really did not like it.
In all terms, he has a very dignified personality in Latvia's history, before the death of the President was in serious office - he was very demanding.
In the near future, the famous villages in Suvorova was in the streets of Suvorova to 3, where the stationary and Coisonists Society emerged, with the Latvian state in practical negotiations.
He was always progressive.
I was not a great fan of the Ulmaa but he did not object to him either.
"In private negotiations, it has sometimes said that it was not a simplistic business," Strange said.
There is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption in lively life.
How does the earth remember today?
It is a shame, but a lot of he associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, thought was centrally.
"She did not have any great shocks at his time: he might associate with a real stable presidency," Strange added.
During the Long-Territory Presidency, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's visit to Sweden has also been taking place in Sweden, which implicitly enjoyed full recognition in neighbouring countries and joining the northern European democratic nation.
On 28 May 1929, a country visited the country in Stockholm.
On 29 June 1929, Swedish troops held a reply visit to Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871 and went on to death in January 1939.
Simple ways of helping a child to cope with anger slowness.
I often face the fact that the anger of the child, the emergence of niche parents is seen as incorrect and abnormal.
When a child openly shows its anger - we do not know how to react, 'Econet' indicates the psychoe Jekatings Kesa.
A specialists are encouraging a small round of talks on these natural and humane feelings - anger and nikhs, which are being experienced by each other periodically.
Agreens - this is already a physical activity directed against another man, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, angry - usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can read our anger and nikes in the face: to say, suppress, hide, keep quiet, tell our friends or other relatives, we can scrap the dirty, praise cigarettes, go through a cork and do other things that are normally not doing.
We do not target our aggression against others because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are screaming anger, do not understand what they are going to describe and how they can live with them.
They can say: 'Ej prom!', Tu esus fool, 'I do not see you' - 'I do not mean you' - and very rarely when you can say 'I am angry.'
Children live literally, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneously and truly sympathetic to their feelings, and often live in a variety of emotions.
It is very important that older children do not ban their feelings, including anger, do not shame it and not, but on the contrary, help the child.
Does it need to be accompanied?
A long working day in which everything has not taken place quite simply as you would like, or simply bad, is so many reasons why I would like to pick up the day, day or even longer 'from across the globe.
Can a moment be packed for relations and a little breathing?
Or does it tell us that each of the partners has their own way to go?
Congratulations are divided on the various ages.
One (23) is short and succinctly: "In my view, if you need a passport, you do not come with the real man."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has found a scheme that can help somebody.
If you feel that a partner is beginning to fall outside the slightest specimen, then surely it is the right moment to study other hunting fields in order to see if you do not think about him or even don't think about him any more.
So the answer is yes, you can save time and understand how important you have a second half way.
Kaspars (29) reveals their theory.
In my view, relations have to be held on one another every day because, if accompanied by people every 24 hours a week, seven days per week, the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I read every detail that the other is doing and it is starting to fall.
People are starting to stop each other, especially when it is not even more than saying anything about what you have done by day.
My personal experience makes this think so, so I have also failed to resist relations for more than a couple of months.
If you think it is better, elsewhere or elsewhere, why do this woman, with whom you come together, deserve something that can think that there is not enough good and behind the mountains in the countryside?
Things alone are already small.
If there is no, there is not.
"I have it, so I would like a little to condemn those who do not have."
The King (33) is an entirely opposed view of you.
I feel that everyone needs time breathing.
You will not be able every moment, all the time, from morning to the night to watch one another in eye and raining about the love love.
Have got down!
There are so many things - friends, work, balling.
All has its own time.
Of course, friendship or wife, but when both are aware of their balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live up to the grain.
That is what it is all about.
Machinery (27) says: "It is hard to say, need or not to take it, but one thing is clear - it is clear that it does not exist in relations to the end."
If this question is raised, it must be estimated that there will be any change in the near future, on the right or the bad side, depending on the same.
I think, while you are still young and crazy, it is always necessary - for all the time - but when everything remains serious and relations go far beyond another phase, there can be no talk of rerest.
You decide to spend all your monks together!
"If you are not able to withstand one another society and then need breathing space, then when you will be pensioners who comment on the wet hot and the argument about who should better describe the day," Abolish (19).
All the words have been changed.
With its enthusiasm and enthusiasm, the Rozenza first woke the interest of the lats on the artificial arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latin people who, as such, will remain inforgotten," said Romans Suta at the time.
2016, a year in which an early retrospective eruption of the old meistol in the restaurated Latvian National Army museum is clear: the Rosen is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but it is already available to visitors from 13 August and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Army Museum, with a wide retrospection in the newly-opened case of High Speakers, honours gleznoker Jani Rozental (1866-1916), which marks the 50th birthday at international level as part of the calendar day by UNESCO.
A backward exhibition covering more than 150 work is one of the main events of the 10th anniversary of the 10th anniversary of the 10th anniversary of the 10th anniversary of the year.
The sample of domestic work is largely formed from the Latvian National Arts Museum, which is decidedly representative of the main stages of the creative activity of the classical works and dams, style change and the diversity of techniques.
In addition, expropriates from Akseli Gallena-Kallelas museum, Wasque museum, Liepaja museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland.
The elephant mode bombs the presence of a photograph, exhibition mobile apps reveals some works of art with photographs, with photos taken by the giant to innovate with his photo.

A similar extract with the presentation of contents in English, Finnish and Swedish in the autumn will be opened in the autumn in Helsinki.
Meta Levlanks is looking forward to a return to Topigar this summer.
Miss Leblanca told the television broadcaster Miss Levlanca that he looked forward to a return to the automobile this season in the second season, but said that he did not know what is expected to happen in the future.
So far, nothing formally happens.

Cologgova is refusing to stand as a candidate for the head of the Revenue Service.
The head of the Public Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, decided to withdraw its candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VD), LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Collegova points out that the consultation of her candidature has multiplied the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
The fact that the real reasons for discussion relate to politicians' vision, but more often, to non-prospective interests and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
"That's not acceptable to me," he said.
If her candidature was approved in government, it is clear that it would not be a conclusive vote and would not allow for a fully-fledged vote and for the necessary changes to the Revenue Service, with all the support of the government.
Without it, full work would not be possible, concluding Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly said publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now all my candidature is over-politicised," he said.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, it is the experience that I cherish as a benefit," Reizniece-Ozofula writes to Kolegova.

The Riga Stop introduced all recommendations of the VC with regard to the Russian island project.
The Riga Open Port administration has introduced all five National Inspections (VC) recommendations on the development of the project infrastructure for the transfer of Russian troops from the centre of the city centre, Vza Diena.lv informed the company.
The project is planned for the forthcoming meeting of the Riga Airport Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the advice of the UC to prepare the documentation necessary to implement recommendations, Riga Open Port Management also led to the conclusions of the legal and operational audit of the International Auditor Deloitte Riga International Monetary Management and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project during the next project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent today to the GC.
Despite the fact that the Riga Open Port Government does not agree with the opinion of the VC on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for implementing the project and donor trust - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all construction work planned under the project has been fully completed within the prescribed deadlines and planned amounts.
"In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VC and also the sticker, that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all recommendations of the VC on project management and monitoring issues," said Sanita Kaire, head of the Russian island project.
The aim of monitoring and monitoring the progress achieved by the project was accompanied by key planned actions and deadlines for the parties concerned and the necessary time-limits, meetings and regular reporting tools, the planned monitoring tools for the construction process, as well as key definitions for border points.
The approved Action Plan to achieve the aim of the project by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the VC, complements monitoring actions, thereby reinforcing the control of the timing of actions by other parties involved in implementing the project from Riga Airport.
The development of project management and potential risks to mitigate potential risks have been developed by a project management plan defining project management areas and indicating the documents developed to ensure the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
The project's capacity building has developed a project management framework which reflects the structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functionalities of its staff.
With a view to enhancing port security communication with the parties involved, a draft communication plan for stakeholders in addition to the parties set out in the project action plan shall be defined by stakeholders, principles of exchange of information, pathways and periodicity.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of funds, further justification will be given to the need for a service contract or to the need for procurement and the rule of law.
As part of the project, a port infrastructure is built on a Russian island, with four new deep-water supplies, rail links, as well as civil engineering.

German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities on communist miles could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims remain undispelled.
According to the data transferred to the House on Wednesday, the Berlin Wall museum Checkpoint Charlie captured between 1945 and 1989 at the border with Western allies and murdered 1841 people who tried to get out of their controlled territory.
The artillery has been studying the number of frontier fatalities for years and recycles the number of victims every day.
A further 11 fatalities are added to the list this year, including a six-year-old boy that drowned by trying to enter western Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall, the Soviet army's deservers are also victims.
"The magnitude of the magnitude of the double communist and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said Alexander Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the capitals of those who died trying to escape from the communist controlled state are serviced and disappeared."
However, the new figures have already been questioned by other researchers.
"Sharm 1841 is unconvincing," Süddeutsche Zeitung said in an interview with the University of the University of Berlin, Johensen.
He, together with the other researchers of the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing the possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far only 260 cases have been approved.
In the past, the researchers have estimated that 138 people murdered by Communists alone.
In view of those who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or enter the West through neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach around one thousand.
However, this is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the different causes of the number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie museesi also counts all cases of suicide of East Germany border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their services.
Byage is also counted on cases of death, which are not linked to direct violence.
"If the ancient ages between 70 and 80 years after the border control died from the heart," this should be the consequences of this "murderous border," he said.
It is, however, convinced that there should be a distinction between the old people who may have died as a result of their experience and those whose death has led to prolonged waiting lists on the bus at the border.
Regardless of the list of victims, it is not easy, because the communist East Germany did not accumulate such statistical data, and researchers must file documents in different scattered archives.
However, this group has recently introduced new texts and could therefore come up with an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
The LPF president Pone to Rio with coaching accreditation; himself is surprising.
In the last few days, the featured famine won the Latvian Federation of Powers (LPF), Kaspars Pone in Rio de Janeiro in the Olympic Games, but feel amazed by it.
On Wednesday, there were widespread attacks following the awards of the Olympic Charlemagne Youth Prize, Germans Jakubovska, who said that, at the last minute, Rio de Janeiro decided to go to Pone while the training had to remain at home.
Orthodox Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins, coach Jakuboos and Deivus Kolinos, as well as president Pone, were originally signed on the list.
The Latvian Federation's Federation of Punishment commented five participants, and even before the departure Algon Vrublevskis said that Germans would be and are searching for their tickets.
"However, for obvious reasons he did not," he said, saying that he had not affected the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvja pledged her to help her.
Pone, who himself is a member of the Executive Committee of the LOC, strongly criticised the functioning of the LOK, leading to the guilt of the interior organisation of Olympic sport.
In my view, it is an unethical LOC executive committee to approve five individuals and one of them not to be blown up.
"I don't know why the Federation of Prisbarak did not have a place," Pone said that the Society was not valued by federations and their presidents, recalling that the federations do not receive salaries.
He criticised himself on his own Jakubovski, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved by the member, he looked at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any sportspeople.
I was unable to tell him why he was in the Olympic Games with a coaching accreditation, which was probably due to Jakubovskim.
"I wrote as a federation president (" team leader "), but for some reasons he received the accreditation of the doctor and now wouldn't stop at home."
The situation has changed every day, the number of accredited accreditation has changed.
Until the last moment, I think Germans will be because I did not have any other information.
After the information held by LETA, a couple of days before the Ribakow Started, she has been speaking with the Italians and he was ascribed with the bast, while LPF president said that it had been a daily conversation with the wish of sportsmen prior to the start.
He said that the LPF monitors five sports events in the Olympic programme and four of them are undergoing training for children in Latvia.
The President of the federal said that in Latvia it is also very important to have drowning issues and also for programmes such as the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018, the World Cup will be able to deal with Latvia.
The presence of Rio de Janeiro is not my leave, I worked, wasted my time and attempting to implement the four-year programmes.

More than 600 000 homosexuals and Tamil babies will be trapped in Daugava this year.
Already for the second year, juvenile fish have been marked by cutting the fat spiral before landing.
There are 25 000 traces with an average weight of 31,3 grams in the absent mile today.
Each year, the composition and numerical scale of scientifically based species in Daugava and its basins water will be taken into account for the recruitment of juveniles and wedware.
The propagation of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water body shall be carried out by Bior on the basis of the economic activities of the Latvian economic activity, on the basis of the loss of loss caused by fish resources and by providing a conclusion as to which compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, the national environmental service, on the basis of the expertise, shall decide on the scope and nature of the compensation.
The annual amount of compensation per Latvia for the recovery programme for Latvia amounts to EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvia in cooperation with the Society "We fish" hosts 400 artificial fish spaces into Daubalt and Croats.
Cooperation with the Society through the promotion of natural spaces of fish is Latvia's energego further supported by an initiative within the framework of the recovery programme for fish resources.
The deployment of climate-friendly spawning structures in water is an important measure contributing to the protection and propagation of fish resources in Daugava.

The French court rejects the requirement to dismantle stores in the camp of the camp in the camp in the camp in the camp.
The French court rejected the request from the authorities to confuse dozens of self-established shops and restaurants in the camp in the Jungle camp, where several thousand refugees live.
In a hearing held this week in Calais, the authorities had indicated that the country had to confuse 72 self-established stores where people are traded in the camp by various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, with 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro in self-proclaimed restaurants.
In Calais, the prefect office said that these self-established companies should be demolished because they constitute a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as the risks of fires and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group have explained to the Court that these small companies are essential because the food provided by governments and supporting groups does not guarantee the needs of the camp where the number of residents continues to rise.
They also pointed out that the shops and restaurants of houses often offer free shelter and food for those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who created 72 self-imposed shops, but it understands the prefect of the Iron.
Speaking at the plenary session in Strasbourg he said that "food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food for people who live in extremely tight conditions."
He said that these sites were a peaceful meeting for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of dismantling is the camp cafles' Jungle Book Kids', which provides more than 200 free meals, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors without adult management.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of the child cafe.
The letter addressed in the Guardian states that the liquidation of the cafe would "be a disaster for those children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity organisations' Assistance for Refugees' and L'Auberge des Migrants said that the number of residents of the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people, the highest since the sharp increase in the influx of migrants during the summer.
Britain won a silver regasi-7 series in the fight when Fiji's National Party wins gold.
The spectacular edition of Britain's sample in regain-7 rankings ended on Thursday when the exodoro stadium on the Rio Fiji Screen massed them with a result in 43: 7.
Fiji held a meistarch in a bomb administration, the ball game with her feet, supports the game and brutality in the game, racing gold, the first Olympic medal in its history.
Save a dignified peace prize - a silver medal that was a third piece of Britain this afternoon - the British rebate can be proud of his successes at the first Olympic Rhattan 7 in Turkish-South Africa.
In a war in half a millennium, where the Boks was defeated by the result of 7: 5 days in the first half, the UK was able to win the flask.
But in any case, Fiji's sample is now in its best form to win 15 husbands.
Although little plaintible, a certain calamity for Britain could be the fact that at least one brush won gold medals; it is Fiji's main coach Ben Ryan, a former Engineering coach from Vimmindón.
It was a fascinating adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all at the moment of the regiment of the regasi-7 series in Adeshow.
This time they lost just one game.
Production is painful, but growth is astonishing.
Fiji was impressed by the mask by rebuilding Britain's method of force.

In the seventh minute of the game Jasa Veremaláua arrived in the good corner by reinforcing the surplus of Britain to 17: 0.
After the interplay, the Nakarava increased its weight more than the end of the first half, until the end of the first half.
Mr Vatanen has avoided a few setbacks in Britain's method and crossed the line by raising the points.
Full result was estimated at 29: 0.
Fiji was born to play with regiment in Rhine-7 miles while brothers are still studying.
This, in fact, is true.
The British team did a profound change in lunch with Fiji's game code... full four minutes, which, after the first half-time standards, were good until Zhana Tuisov, after the fantastic teammates, got a few more points for Fiji's teammates.
Deniss Norsson was able to reach the British team for the leftist corner and achieved a result of 36: 7, while the game was lost, while the South naked fighter took off, shot the flags and deck in tribines.
There is no appalling attitude of Fiji's life.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even freer with another bedrock at the end of the game.
Fiji could start to celebrate the end of the game, but the British people were able to sit in the room after the defeat.
On the first half of the first half of Fiji, Fiji scored Japan with a result of 20: 5, while brothers were more than South Africa, where the two teams were in sharp contrast between the two teams and the South phrase lost just a few points.

It will be the most emotional gold medals in these race and it is already making a great deal.
From the first to the last storm, Hellas Gloveres and Hetel Staningas gold had a particular role to play in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the boats are just two athletes, they accompanied by Robin Vilysa, who inspired them until the second Olympic gold medal in airing women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport, which has achieved such success.
They were unquestionably dominated because 39 times they were not able to win, an unprecedented victory.
The two excellent athletes with the bed elegant drowned by the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gated gold writing there is a whole team that is working hard to keep athletes constantly improving their performance and the largest contributor to their performance has given the coach, who did not know until 30 months ago, because he was diagnosed with cancer.
After what he said, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had a wake-ink cancer that is one of those who can operate and that happened.
If we did not do so, it would spread all the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It is a bit changing the vision of the present.
The falsification was detected in December 2013.
This trio has made it possible that Vilami could start the recovery proceedings at the beginning of the 2014 Crop and to reduce the duration of the interruption to a minimum, if it can be said.
I had a need for income and I therefore had to recover quickly.
It has boosted recovery.
I was in hospital and I went out for 6, 10 and even 15 metres to distance, although the doctor said that some steps were enough.
All this started.
Airports are a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After winning, the first idea was immediately a Villau, which had been very disturbing and worryingly influenced by the wake-up.
The Stanning, which is the day in the Caralian Artillery Union in Afghanistan, said: 'This was an emotional big week, but that means a great deal'.
This only confirms how much it means and how much I, Helena and Robin have been working.
The 3 years of Helena and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better teacher or better training.
Helena Glover and Hetere Standing for five years have not lost any race.
The rest comes at such a huge rate with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Standing and Globile were too big.
We felt every moment.
Helena was denied: 'Keeping the rolling tricks, keep a rite'.
Lack of concentration is really important.
We did a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we did not have the intention of saving records, but it is simply good to row and win the races and that is what we did.
The rest of the year will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be a soldier and a queue of Stalin's brigade.
For the time being, she simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
This would have been too much pressure.
I took around six months in London to realise that I am the Olympic champion.
It was new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it took around four minutes.
She said: 'Trust is fantastic'.

Cologgow VID "will advance to the last."
According to his words, Prime Minister Mārim Kučinskim (Greens / Farmers) and Minister for Finance, Danai ReizniePri-Ozoom (Greens / Farmers) are already "principally important," to confirm the Commissioner-led candidate Kolegova.
Rajevo has estimated that both Kuchink and Reizniece-Ogolai's approval of the Revenue Service is the first big decision, which may have an impact on him as a future politician.
If you now change the position of the Revenue Service's candidate, then it will have a negative impact on the public administration of their imidge.
On the agenda for the next week, the headquarters of the CVD will be on the agenda, according to the headquarters of the Revenue Service of VVD, according to the government's agenda.
Reizniece-Ozola of Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola of Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola of Finance Minister Cologgow, following his resignation with Inaugural Petersone and when the post of Director General of the Revenue Service ended inconclusively.
On Thursday 11 August, a member of the Revenue Service's assistant, Dace Peliety, said in an interview with Latvian Radio - if she were to stand as a leader, she could agree.
The Minister for Finance later admitted that he had not yet considered the other candidates for the Revenue Service.
Rivis Dzintars, the leader of the National Alliance Group, said that it was increasingly supported under the leadership of the Collegova Revenue Service.
Spain's deficit reduction potential is threatened by the inability to establish a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal failed to implement sufficiently extensive measures to limit the level of the deficit to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the euro area.
Estimates indicate that, despite the austerity measures taken, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4. 4% of GDP and 5. 1% in Spain.
The European Commission has, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the next time.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet introduced sanctions against both these countries is the growing Euro-scepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase this negative sentiment.
Critics also point out that the EC has not been consistent in its decisions by initiating agreement on uniform rules and then failing to apply them into practice.
For example German Bundesbank's President Jense Veidmanns indicated that Europe is losing trust in such a way by giving citizens the impression that European Union rules are recommendations rather than binding.
Now the EC has proposed and all Member States have approved the deadline for the adjustment of the budget deficit until the end of this year to Portugal and until 2018 to Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts indicate that the target set by Portugal could be achieved in due course and this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government must implement a saving measure of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention being paid to the control of the costs of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more difficult.
This year, the budget deficit must be reduced to 4. 6%, next year to 3. 1% and 2018, to 2. 2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures must be 0. 5% of GDP per year over the next two years.
It is particularly difficult to achieve these goals that the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on the establishment of the government for eight months and become increasingly an opportunity for Spain to have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a third year.
However, public opinion polls suggest that the third elections would also significantly change the political landscape in the country.
The most popular party is still a party leader of the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, whose election would once again get a little 33% of the votes.
The popularity of its people has only increased the Socialists, while the austerity measures against Podemos, or 'Together we can' and 'Ciudadanos', or 'Citizens', have diminished somewhat.
The People's Party wants to get a socialist and "Ciudadanos" involvement in the government again this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the 2017 draft budget to the European Commission for approval.
As the representative of the People's Party's parliamentary faction, Rafael Hernando has stated, if governments do not succeed and parliamentary elections will still be organised for the third time, Spain will become a whole European appalling.
The purity of clean fish in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After my fifth anniversary, the activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste recovered has been rising year-on-year and the number of sites visited here is responsible.
The most pollutant bathing sites are in Riga.
The Capital Award clarifies that bathing sites should be treated daily, but the fight against unattainable visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, the waste underground wastes can be enrolled in water during the rainfall and thus seriously damaging its quality.
Apart from the skin beaches and certain places in Kurzeme, pure clean in other places in Latvia is critical.
This is the announcement this week by the volunteers of the campaign entitled 'My sea'.
Fifty years on the road along the Gulf of Riga, the activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has risen to a hundred metres every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year, the criticisms have come to an end.
"We can see that this will be a year when the number of waste on beaches 100 metres can probably even exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme.
Latvian Radio calls, he found immediate beaches, where a voluntary move along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year between different urban waste and the pikole palace the activists had to collect sunlight bulbs that leave the waves on the sand of the sea.
The voyage participant and the organiser Ulric, pollute the blame directly.
"The main source is the beachmales themselves, since more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces, which are already in the disturbance stage, can no longer be identified and smoke, bottles, cords," Ulrus. "
There are also bathing areas in Riga, among the neckest beaches.
For example, almost 800 waste units, which are critical, on average per hundred metres per hundred metres.
The organisers of the campaign also make it clear that you can also carry out smokers and not everywhere in the alert or ban.
"The average figures for all three Rare bathing sites together - DaugavGeorgians, VOUrives and Others - unfortunately fall far short and far outweigh the desired or target of reducing the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender concludes by 202020.
The cleaning of camping in Riga during the summer season, in the summer's hotspot, even twice, explains the spectacular representative Usin Vidauskis.
However, the fight against non-cleared visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to this cultural issue.
"Those who use rice, tobacco use alcohol, smoking and do all the things that cannot, even in particular, work," he said.
High-level visits to the police should therefore be reported to the sites.
It is possible to call the police to make sure that there is a safe reference to these abuses and thus all to fight.
Perhaps some new warnings may be imposed, but, as I said, hardly any radically alter the situation.
"As everyone together must simply stop and be intolerant against such offenders," he emphasized.
In the meantime, the water quality measurements this summer has been carried out for the fourth time by the Health Check, which may provide a ban on formal bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that at all 56 bathing sites the quality of water has been good for all the time and there is no bathing restriction.
"The last time we will be looking at the end of August," said Normunds Kadić, senior specialist in environmental health.
Downstream waste in heavy rainfall may be labelled in water.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, indicate an environmental expert.
Rotation in Russia's elites continues: Changing the head of the Putin administration.
A job was abandoned?
Vladimir Putin has said to Russian media that Sergei Ivanov had wanted to leave this post to his own and will henceforth be a Special Representative for nature protection, ecology and transport.
By announcing a change, Putin was given the words of Ivanov in front of the television cameras: 'Ciennius Sergej Borisovič, we are working together and doing so well for many years'.
I am pleased with the way in which you have fulfilled your duties.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this presidential administration for more than four years.
This is why I raise awareness of your desire to change the scope of the action.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new job.
However, it is emphasised that the administration of the presidential administration is a very important piece of office and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that the Duma elections are expected in Russia next month, it was rumoured that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called the President of Putina as President of Putina, so his claim that he himself wanted to take the post of President of the President for nature protection and transport raises doubts.
Ivanov is a master master of the KGB and the Federal Security Service, according to Gula.lv archives.
Ivanov has been a sand and a close ally by the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started in 1975 when he took note of Putin.
Later, Putin became an alternate member of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov.
On the other hand, the first Russian President, Borisa, was appointed Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Security Council.
In 2002, after Putin's arrival, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by the Ivanova was confirmed, including in Russia the revival of the national censorship mechanisms.
In 2002, Sergei Ivanov became Minister for Defence of Russia, but already in 2005, the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Farokova and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industries and arms exports.
Now, after the resignation of the head of the Presidency, Ivanov will also keep a seat on the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the President's administration is also working in the Vilnius.
Words come from family councils in elites.
The head of the office of the President of the President, Vaino said himself in his own Ivanov.
We have long been familiar with the Antonis Eduardoviate.
Then of the time when you worked on the government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years we contacted practically every day.
"So I'm convinced that, after all professional and personal qualities, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The landscape comes from a family that belonged to the elites of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karls took senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years up to 1988, was its first secretary.
The "honey" bill, with reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence," says that, at the end of 80s, Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against the demonstrators.
However, he had received a refusal and has lost his post shortly.
Shortly afterwards, the landscape has moved to Moscow.
Antonis Waino has both been crushed by the Moscow International Institute of Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the Bureau's protocol.
It has already been said that the latest riots in Russia were shocked by the exhibition and even arrests of several senior officials, including the replacement of a multi-area governor and federal representatives.
President Vladimir Putin has resettled the ruling elites before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing frequency of managerial positions.
Saddam Hussein was also losing the Olympic Games in the first fight of the Olympics.
This was the first round of the fight, and Latvian riders have concluded their participation in the Olympic Games by finalising in 17 place.
Trenner Oleg Baskins Latvian Television said that Nov. es were very short of hope and it has already been clear before the competition.
He also found that he wasn the crowd in the fight.
Significantly, in order to go to the Olympic road signs, the Newikifool had to be launched in another weight of weight than the note - weight to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan treated 25 kilograms harder.
"It's all right to have a fine girl," he said.
So Latvia has concluded the town of Judo.
Sappiles disappear in the Rio Tilm.
The fourth day was crossed by jacdium Jevgetis Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more condense opponent, but the ambitious sometimes is capable of surprise.
He did not miss.
The task was even more difficult, because experience smaller and opponent will also be adhered to.
The outcome, like him, held a half a minute longer than Borodavko, for his time.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of ambition in the past few days in Latvia's legs.
Gunars Kirsons and his financial star Vladimir Spyvoov said that "the Golden Score" is no longer in the hands of Latvia in the wake of the collapse of the federation, and the Golden Score is not taking place, and the rabbit develops the curve curve.
Mr Jackevich, who is advised here in Kazakhstan, and Vsevolt Zovolt does not see the heirs.
But if they do not grow, there will be no.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
This is why, as part of the other galaxy Rates panorama, a pledge by the Latvian Judo Federation's President in the Rio bloc would be scrapped.
The flight is far from reality.
In the evening I was looking forward to Zurlese / Pee Solberg with the impatience and concern of the beachen voylese maize Samoilovs / Schinedither.
Intravenile, as already in the 'death' group, the losers are over.
Latvia's dupe was a small digression: it could also lose, but up to four points in two separate articles.
The tension was still the last game of the previous game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling above the stormy corn across the corner.
There were further complications in force majeure.
At the beginning, it seemed to be ours - which is more comprehensive - an ally.
But we did not.
It was quite simple to play the Latvian dual role here.
Series so far as Samoilogue and wait for him to bury.
There was a break-up to Canada against Cuba at the end of the first sixth and at the start of the third, because the load was not a joke.
It could have been possible at that time because the work was not enough, but when there were, it was good to do so.
Rather Samoilovs could win the two faces with the Ship since the first stew of leadership with 16: 15, but also 16: 15, while also exhausted the number of points lost.
But it was also possible to lose 0: 2 because the second sixth deficit was 4, but thanks to the wind, it managed to win a victory.
The third was the jet of Evangem.
Shardy corner - unconvincing serve, the second match often fly to the grid and Samoilovam leaves a very little version to an offensive attack.
If there was an alien Samoilovs in the square, he worked better this time and it would only be non-professional.
The Kremlin was wrong too, and it was symbolically symbolically that the final bomb block had been hit first.
I couldn the team.
This time, there was certainly a shortage of success - the third faces two Evaneur attacks almost the corner of the corner, but the ball has nevertheless touched the line.
Two ethers were along the line.
The controversial episode has also been ruled out in favour of opponents.
If the first two players were treated with sergewater in the first two games, then it was very productive to our own.
Everything together comes from the pack to the taboo.
The causes of the failure now need to be explored calmly.
Perhaps it was a lot to live in a stadium, not with the letter in the Olympic village of delegations.
There were two and a half hours ahead.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a seven-mile range.
Maybe it was not necessary to play tea, but quickly come here and get a better ray.
Perhaps it was a mistake to find the eruption of the athletic form.
So far more than answers.
Our bishops are over.
The cemetery over the medals.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup Stalin still postponed and also the Jurmala Masters.
Sadly, Samoilova has never been friends and will not be because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, it may also be a question of divorce, as the blame will be sought not only in the face but also in the partner.
It is not difficult, but much more difficult for Latvia to find a worthy partner.
The two brothers play a barber, while Janis has already tried, and also self-boots, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start the world's surface.
It is possible to try to return to Machen Sovevees, Alexander Sovevees, Edgar Tours, but it will not be better than this version, which did not once again showed itself at World Cup stages.
The corn sandder kidnapped them this time.
And so.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that beach voLower is becoming more popular with new coupling, and only the rare crop is less than two metres.
It still does not guarantee success, but there is an important argument in the battle for victory.
The novelty does not stay.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to settle games of games in games of chance and choose their own.
The sample of the US basketball resides on a cruise ship, part of the tennis does not remain in the Olympic village.
Likewise, part of the beachmales voLower has been searched by the hotel in Koroabane.
This time, the incredible nights offered to journalists were subjected to massive exaggerated prices.
That is why the choice has also fallen on the Irish of aparthesis.
The risk is, because sometimes it can be uncomfortable from a logistic point of view.
Risk justifies this time.

On Friday morning, there was another dream of the medals in the morning.
In 100 metres of barriers and higher tempering, Laura Ikauniece-Admidmorning remained at their personal record.
But there are still five discipline.
After a 10-year break in Liepaja, Porgia and Besa skouted.
In Latvia, Porgijs and Besa have experienced an initial study in 1973 in Latvia's National Operation.
Since then, internationally accepted music has repeatedly failed.
This is why the organisers of Causu Arstival and Liepaja Arts Forum in close cooperation have decided to give their audiences the chance to enjoy George Gobshir Gconvene.
"We are very pleased that after a decade, when an operational study could be traced for the last time, this great Easter of George Angeles and Besa will be a spectacular leader in the new, newly opened concert leader Baiba Bože.
"Porgship and Besa" is a spouse for love, partiality, passion and urban tragedies and simple routine queues.
It mirrors Afrost vitality, music and rites.
It is this lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so lively.
"And yes, this love is extremely powerful, hugely loudly and indeed deep."
What I like most - listening or retrofitting the opera - is always the stick points - the famous meloages, famous motives, but these transition from each other to another, paving one personality or another personality, or cork or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, that building," Operation is valuing Operas Porgijs and Besa "concert conductor and conductor Andris Poga."
The participants in operation agree that this is a grand event.
It is a great joy for them to hear the famous Gobshir operational in the world.
Sadly, the Liepaja can feel the breath of the world.
"Entrepreneurship," an operational check is assessed by visitors Edgar Lake.
The concert was a special case for the first time in a newly-opened concert Hall of the first time in orchestra, and the first time was played by an operational concert.
Farming at the Archa museum renovated buildings could be described on behalf of Jaime Rozenza.
He told the House that his address could not be a spectacle in the town of Valdemar in the future, while Jay Rozenau's Award went on 1.
Mobbye director Mar Lurch admitted that the transfer of the address would lead to a long bureaucratic burden, but overall this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed by the municipalities.
The Riga City has put its kind of basic blindness to this idea in 1936, building Burkarda Dauvica's monument to Janim Rosen, which stands at a museum.
The former museum director, Willi, was one of the initiators of building this monument.
In this way, this further activity could be purely logical.
I am a little destroying your conscience at all times - but the Vilhell Purman, where we are going to make his name?!
"But if you stop thinking, Mr America," the Lord said.
It has been said that the National Arts Museum building on an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation officially opened its doors this year in May.
This week, the reconstruction of the SEF Alliance for Culture will finally be launched.
EUR 11 million will be upgraded to the "Velvet" SIA.
It is planned to renovate several spaceways, including two viewers' medicines as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council is expected to raise the €six million money of EU funds, but Oleg Burovs, director of Riga City Viet NO, recognises that the project is not yet fully transparent for the project.
"Despite the political will to launch VEF's cultural pigs by linking the European Structural Funds, we are waiting for months to decide, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether it is money or no," says Burov.
In December last year, we have told us that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission that you are taking the decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
Now we can see that another discussion is emerging, now we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that Riga City has no doubt guaranteed that this process will be launched and completed within the deadlines," he said.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Castle collectively hosted a rewning concert before, immediately, refurbishments of the next building.
Although the year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
Under the Riga City Areas Department Strategy, the renovation of the HEF Culture Caster has been allocated to seemingly independent superstructure work, where everyone will ensure the implementation of different prison functions.
First: increasing the availability of VEF culture and the redeployment of the surrounding area.
It provides for tight and engineering, as well as renovating the building of a building.
Second, improving the supply of services by the VEF Cultural League.
It envisages upgrades, walls and Greek restaurants, audiences and audio recordings, as well as to sorrow buildings into internal civil engineering.
Third, improving the collective working conditions of Creative amateur, which include plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
A legendary Roma can get an exhibition in Liepaja before the Christ 40 jug.
The exhibition will include a wide range of "Llius" objects, the photos chosen in the line to reflect the group's performance from the beginning to 2010 when the group is notified.
Stakeholders, musical instruments, awards and concerts will also be identified, as well as other wider audiences, which were reflected in the creative activities of the group.
The exhibition will be supplemented by the use of Liepaja muzze.
The visual presentation of the exhibition is in cooperation with the art artist and the Zleczów Patient Patmaller.
The musicians who were linked to the group "Lives" and their relatives have also referred to the call and shared with objects and memory.
The boycott starts in 1972 when the Soviets Culture House is set up in the Soviets instrument, led by Juris Pavtols.
Its original membership has participated in the festival Liepaja propulsion in 1972 and 1974, as well as town and republics.
In 1966, a fatal meeting took place when Juris Commontols took note of the Ethics in Church and the Metalurian cultural pilot project, calling for the participation of Indicide Gates, Andrus Krumins and Yander Grodums.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been noticed, not once.
The participants have joined, others have come, some have returned.
Above all, however, the wish to show that Latvian cells are able to live and exist - remained unchanged.
"What you can see is a breakthrough, theory and barress: these boys have made a difference from the universally accepted evolutionary spycott," the group says a group of music players.

Many people are already on the road to the most sacred New Delhi skies in Aglona.
What message do you want to get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglonia has set the Pope's nuncium.
Consequently, the content of the main message is also in his hands.
It is also a form of tradition that the Krusta route is being run by the bishop Janlis Monlis.
He will also make his own message.
I had a blessing of the go-like vigour on the previous day.
Last year, I concentrated on the Francophilia 'Laudato si and updated the common home, the Earth's theme in Latvia's context.
This year, of course, I watched what is happening in the world and I am trying to respond to it.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Islamist message must be put at the centre of life.
It has to be shown that the Casticist is responsible for the most painful problems of human life and gives him an inspiration to forge.
Then it speaks to people.
But, in the Chiek, Lamps, you said that "you should come back to a human touch."
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a man broke out of the church's message?
And is the church today a return resource like this?

A man who has been identified as Matile has been killed and worked as a guardian in the night.
Matile 5: 30 of the morning went to home in the road when he was hit by a light car.

After an hour that nobody has failed to be aware of the blood of a blood, he was robbed by a hernife.
Around 90 minutes after a visit took place the police and the victim have been taken to hospital where the injuries were killed.
In referring to the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (PSD), the head of the Public Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has rescued the government from criticism, according to Professor Sudra, Faculty of the University of Latvia University.
The approval of Kolegous on the withdrawal of nominations in relation to the contradiction in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
Smart talks with LETA confirmed that he would find it difficult to imagine that next week's government would support Kolegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if the ministers of Unity were voted against, but Kolegova so and so, it would result in a government's despair.
The expert also believes that, before the nomination of the nomination, Kolegova has consulted the Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mars Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a concession for 'unity', which firmly opposed her candidacy.
Seizarra said that it was two options: either a compromise figure would be selected, or a body as Director General will continue to lead to Dace Pelyir as the director of the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that, if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that no other nominations have been considered, it is a barrel of the Pylene that it is not possible to take part in the contest.
As reported, the head of the State Environmental Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw its candidacy for the post of Director General of the Revenue Service.
On Tuesday evening, the government gave its green light to the director of the Revenue Service's director of the Revenue Service.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova showed that it is still ready to become a member of the Revenue Service.
However, later thought was changed: on Friday's application to Finance Minister, Danai ReizniePri-Ozoos, she points out that he would withdraw his consent to the seat of the Revenue Service and that she did not give her easy choice.
Prime Minister Mar Kuchinska spokesman Andrei Vaivars said that a new contest will be organised at the Revenue Service's head of the Revenue Service.
An accident involving the audience of the police took place at the centre of Riga.
A road accident involving a public police car has taken place in Riga this afternoon.
The police car, with the connecting lines and lights, has rushed to the skin of the top category until critical of the Strait of the Barona and Dzirnava on the streets of Stalin.
Police explained the circumstances which have taken place, but the initial information shows that the second game has not missed a long police car.

The number of people in Riga this year
At the start of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants, a 0. 34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered 641 000 inhabitants, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Governance (CSP).
In turn, the number of people in Latvia is ranked at 30 points among the capital cities of the European Union (EU) and the large towns where the population exceeds one million.
According to Eurostat, Eurostat data is the highest percentage of women - Latvia's capital is decidedly in the first place among Europe's biggest cities, with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three capitals in the Baltic States, the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
alert pictograms to LNG.
In the coming days at the Latvian National Army Museum (DCM), a warning label will be displayed - a Pictogram, Lieutenant Baiba Gaillate told LETA.
It is now successful that the defective speed corrected by the museum is successfully completed as a result of the scattering operation.
The warning pictograms will be deployed in the coming days.
Its citizens will tell us that the cover has been sick of sick and in the performance, not to be transported by cars and to visit bicycles, trucks and muscles.
Ušakov also wrote on this social network on Facebook, who said that no security risks would cause damage, but "blind allusions" and Sharbordistan "will have to go."
Slate children and elderly are young children's playgrounds.
In this summer season, Riga municipalities have set up even two new rotaic fields in the city, on the Coastal and Chieurish, who are already available to children at the moment.
There is a vast, multifunctional playground vessel with different stelling elements, bridges, games, trubs and bags.
All ages are intended for children.
In agriculture, cells and different balancing components are also installed.

The medicine discovered the reconstruction phase.
Minister Uldis Augulis, Leader of the Latvian National Road (LVC), and representatives of CEOs "Binders" and municipal councillors today opened the country's main motorway (Grebishva) to the Lithuanian border (A13) for the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km).
The road is a country's visit, especially border paths, so particular satisfaction is to reveal a reconstructed phase at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is yet another example of the fact that, thanks to cofinancing of European funds, the situation on the main roads of the country is improving.
"As projections predict, the funds available during this programming period will be on track in 2018 and we must think of continuing to maintain the most burdened motorways in good quality, and also to ensure mobility for citizens in all Latvia's regions without EU funding," Uldis Augulis emphasized.
The Minister for Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by road experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads in the near future will be presented to the government.
In the period from the hunt to Lithuania's border (156,4-163,05 km), SIA Binders began last year and this year continued after a technological break.
The cost of the service is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The design phase is a complete phasing out of the road and repairs will start next year from the hunts to Daugavyyberg, so it will bring all road from Lithuania's border to Daugavjilij," said the head of the LVC board chairman Janis Lange.
The main motorways of the country are the most busy and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all the main motorways in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to sustain them in good quality by providing timely maintenance and the spread of asphalt to an asphalt every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require appropriate financing and all the people with hope are looking at the proposals put forward by the group of experts to adjust the road financing system," he said.
Road connections and lighting in the centre of the hunt will be arranged through the project.
Large terrestrial jobs are carried out: in four phases, mass atrocities and painful printing and embankment works, levelled down the longitudinal plane, which has so far been very unevenly unevenly distributed.
The return of public transport links and rebuild the land for public transport has also been renewed.
In the past, there was insufficient intrusion and an area relative to the mountains had not been transparent because of the mountainous valleys as well as the old tram of the old road.
The next construction work in the season is planned to rebuild a motorway from the town of Daugavpils to the reconstructed phase (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, the LVC intends to carry out different types of work more than 1,100 kilometres of the country's roads.
The information on all renovations planned for the national road network is available at LVC homepage: www.enceli.en.
"In order to achieve the desired weight reduction results, the correct choice of food supplements is essential," said Lithuanian dietoloģe Laura Romeraite-Krrain.
In addition, it is easy to achieve during the summer period when our own vineyards grow fresh fruit, olives and vegetables.
Combined food combination can help not only reduce overweight, but also in a targeted way to promote different organisms.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, as it provides a long-standing wake-up and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition magazine have shown that the label has a positive impact on glucose levels and helps us feel encouraged.
Coal pives and proteins hold baggage, such as poultry or proteins, cause not only feelings of cheese but also reduces the cards after large meals in future food.
This combination of food is also capable of increasing the amount of calorie infiring calorie to 35%.
Studies show that Kajibetwei can be helped to get rid of the fats of the fats.
The ozone contains a nutrient nutritional - choline, while the passport is a good source of vitamins C.
By taking sufficient amounts of this nutrient it may reduce the level of corrol and hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
The beautiful foot, with fresh oves, is another long and fat fertiliser for breakfast, which is worth integrating into their minds.
Poor pads and oars contain fibre which, according to the Canadian scientific findings, controls the grey of the dietened hormones - and thus a sense of hunger.
In addition, the ports contain polyphenols of palliative weight and do not allow for fat.
Codets and proteins are also capable of making miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a sense of compost.
Precifiers contain water and fibre and therefore contribute to the feeling of the snow.
At the same time, protein is slowing the digestive process and provides a sense of snow for a longer time.
Over lunch, they can eat with the straw or prepare proteins of proteins from the finished mixture and enjoy it with their favourite vegetables.
Any combination of products should be avoided.
Fruit is sugar - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecule compounds.
In contrast, the starch in vegetables is a polistic charter.
The plants shall be mechanically separated, while chemically separated, the third or fourth degree in digestive processes taking place in the yards.
The gap is divided into three different phases which are starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the island off the corner right after the meals.
Give the straight to the meal, immediately after the meals, it is "inconceivable" with other shoes where it is not chemically dissolved and is beginning to pull.
Do not eat masses, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers or other carbohydrate products, together with citrons, happily, orange, diamonds, ananasants or other acids.
Enzyl pthalmine, which is in salmon, only functions in a roscephalous environment.
Fruit acids prevent the removals not only of carbohydrates but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk, eggs and nuts and similar protein products at the same time.
Their recycling needs different digestive juice, each with different strength, characteristics and time when it comes to melting.
Argsque, singer, anger and other melons should always be eaten separately from other shoes.
The Melones are not being removed if they are in a corcry with other foodstuffs.
Auo combination with proteins baggage products.
Austerity constitutes a successful combination with villages, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein: fat hampers the removals of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If large quantities of proteins are consumed, you will avoid the use of fat at all.
This also applies to fresh meat - it is not advisable to combine a large quantity of nut (containing protein) with healthy avoxado (contains fat).
Such a combination hinders the reduction of effective weight.
How can we make better?
"Efforts preparation, terrestrial treatment lead to a significant loss of nutrients, between 15% and 55% of the original nutrient profile," said the ditoloģe.
In most cases, the nutrient is lost when food is harvested in water.
However, the value of nutrients for some foodstuffs is increasing, directly weakened.
After vegetable washing, it is advisable to use the liquid for salmon: in this case, the nutrient that has remained in the water will not lose, and you can eat it later.
It would be advisable to prepare the garden, too, by asking them.
Terrestrial treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of fibrous oils in tomatoes.
If tomato 30 minutes are concerned, the rate of liquid is increasing by 25%.
The therapies are also a significant increase in the bioavailability of betaklenna in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, in the villages, freed potts and lights.
Oil and meat terrestrial treatment shall remove the natural properties of the proteins present, making them more readable.
Similarly, the processing of meat and eggs is making the iron and other mineral substances contained in these products easier to absorb the organism.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products may reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to even 90%, which does not affect the freezing of the fibre.
Powers in combination with tomatoes may increase the Iron Curtain, which in turn provides for a better functioning brain and muscle activity.
Our organism absorbs up to 33% of the less bloodless iron to be found in plant products such as dust, leather green, cereals, cereal products than blood borne fruit, fish and poultry.
You can significantly increase the absorption of un-cardiovascular Iron into the organism by using the products containing non-circulation of non-fertilled iron, together with vitamins, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-circulation iron to make it easier for our organism to absorb it.
The Iron is necessary for the production of Hurricanine, which provides the oxygen supply to muscle and brain.
To reap maximum benefit from the strains, add healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil.
In preparing for butter worries, add up with Dean of vitamin vitamins or sadder bones, which are a good method of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcible calcium and plays an important role in the process of drawing a bone.
Auza (as well as other development products) together with vitamins C, such as strawberries, river, avenes and other fruits or coal, help to stabilise the cholesterol level as well as avoiding plotting arteria.
Anischat effect criticism of the caring of protesters
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has inspired anxiety, but some commentators claim that it is racist insensitive.
With this slower effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in an amazing way and play their identity.
You can turn yourself into an anancist, dog or a father to download the Roja Lihštenstein.
There are spray, pictorial musical instruments, which generates more than 30 million converted selfia per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public.
Snapchat lenses have already been criticised in the past with the accusations that the app upholds too black oils or pictorial minds as an ideal beauty.
This week, the new lenses have been published, allowing users to form a seismic, varying dams and footwear, and some critics called it a racist bromine caricature - yellow gay.
It was also a question of whether this contradiction shows that companies have more problems with diversity.
The reports and the public's disaster were fired on Wednesday when spending on the Verge and Motherboard reported that the slow effects were removed from the app.
The prophet explained that the snow objective is to portray Ankara's fathers instead of wiping the people of the country of origin.
People who have experienced racism, however, were reminded of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Ankara.
Referring to the edition of the American Armed Forces, Greisas Sparapani, an edition of the Korean Artistic Study on Film, said in an e-mail newspaper she said that the lenses were "offensive and uncomfortable to say more."
She went on to say that it is difficult to unnotice the visible similarity between asiate cartoons and slowdown effects.
This shows that the cheap effect is not just a yellow face but the yellow face the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion from business meetings to Hollywood and devices we use in everyday life.
And Snapchat the large number of young people representing different race, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create a picture that lends users then "nowadays these things do not remain unnoticed," he said in an interview on Thursday for 25 years of Keith Foundation.
On Thursday MEPs adopted a report on the issue of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
In her article "Medium" and telephony, she explained that she said, problems in connection with the racks are due to Snapchat employment policies, which do not sufficiently support racial diversity.
They were critical of the management of the company, which mainly consists of white men and then concluded its article by referring to #DelegvenSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in an enterprise, so such decisions are tolerated: in an enterprise, some other racial representatives are employed, but they do not take the position to be safe and convenient to express their opinions."
She also agrees with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many people represent different race, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but his representative revealed that the company was a staff expert who will focus on the presence of racial minorities who are not well-represented and will contribute to the inclusion in the enterprise.
On the other hand, they will not update their Snapchat account, adding: 'Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to realise that it is not right'.
The Congress of Congress states that the reports of the Islamic State were distorted by military officials.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress of Congress points out that the US Central Trustee representatives distorted the reports by portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it is.
The analysts of the Central American intelligence service show general dissatisfaction at the interim report by the representative of the Armed Forces Committee, the Advisory Committee and the Defence Finance Co-committee, saying that their leadership was controlled by reports of American sexes in the fight against Islamic Courts.
Central research, known as Centimmigration, is the military base in Tampere, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report is that intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom managers reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is in reality; Facts were regularly distorted by portraying better performance than the analysis of another intelligence service.
Kalifornia's Republican representative, Ken Kalverts, says: "Centcom actions are unacceptable: our soldiers are those suffering if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors in senior management of the organisation.
This 10-page report highlights the current challenges in the reflection and analysis of the current problems in the presentation and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide uninterruptible evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration would have liked to mislead the reports, it shows that Centcom's leadership has made some pressure on analysts to show a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State (known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that, in the first half of 2015, the press reorders, statements and reports of the Central Managers Congress display the situation in a considerably more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, Centcom representatives stated publicly that the Mosul recovery operation could start as early as April / May 2015.
Mosua is the second largest city in Iraq, which is still under control over the Islamic State.
Mafra Pompeo, spokesman for the Canadian Republican Party in his report: "A number of months of investigation showed that clearly."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the main officials of the Central Managers of the United States represented the reports by portraying ISIS threats to Iraq, rather than they were in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that the Islamic State was distorted.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by new findings in this case.
The Director-General of the Defence Ministry shall carry out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Group of the Extraordinary Regulatory Committee sent out a report on Thursday to agree with some of the conclusions of the "Republican Party" Task Force.
In his report, the questionnaire, Adami B. Schifs, has overly restricted the preparation of reports of intelligence in relation to ISIS and the security forces of Iraq between 2014 and 2015.
Mr Schifa states that this process' stopped the proliferation of information 'worsened the work of analysts and' disseminated the facts of truth '.
But Shifs and Democratic Party members added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports, in accordance with "previously determined / political positions."
The Daily Bast on Thursday published preliminary results of the Congress's investigation.
In August, the New York Times said that Pentagon General Inspection has opened an investigation after Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, the lieutenant commander of the Pentagon, announced that Pentagon will not comment on the Congress's report as long as the investigation is ongoing.
He added that experts sometimes misinterpretation difficult data, and the Defence Ministry and the Intelligence Authority call for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation only does not apply to the question of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (statements made by an increasingly prominent member of the Defence Ministry).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully count on reports from the Central Managers on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism for Islamic State intelligence recalls more than ten years of events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs posted a study saying that George W. Bush's administration kicked off the Afghan War by too little thinking about its potential consequences.
It also played an important role in detecting Islamic state intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hitler's team revealed that, contrary to public reports, air strikes in the Islamic State's oil factories have not significantly worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group, because they had built up temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this opening did not reach the walls of the Central Managers.
Meanwhile, the Centcom commander of General Lid Ostrict III received sharp criticism, as many laws were considered to be too positive in the statements of war.
In April, General Djozefs Mr Votels, General Djozefs, took office in April.
The US met the United States in a hocle in the field of women in a hocle, win the fourth win in a row.
On the day after a victory over Japan with the result 6: 1, Thursday morning, Keith Bama got first two guns in the US apartment hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with a result 3: 0.
Five grents in two players are a scandal achievement, but 27 years old Bama said that he would not be able to remember whether someone had already succeeded in doing so.
She said, 'I have no idea'.
I am not from those people who are picked up by the gates.
But she knows that the outcome of the American Olympic Games in the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which won them in her group would not belong to the United Kingdom, which, on Thursday, after handing over Japan with the result 2: 0 remained unbeaten.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday to win the first round of the last mask.
Both teams are already qualified by a four-fughest and game only for which team will take the first place in a team of six teams and a second.
The first sites will benefit a little more from meeting with the strong Dutch sample, which is the leader of the second group.
The Americans have already shaken surprises as well as the face of Saturday before the last four years ago in London, with the last place between 12 teams.
It also visited Bama.
She grew in Baft, the lion's holocaust for his first time in 3 years (her oldest daughter's sisters had already dealt with this type of sports in Dataselle) and were joined by a random in the history of the youngest player.
She was not on the Olympic Games in 2008 because he did not get into the flask.
However, 2012 failed to her and her team.
In the next year, an Englishman Kugs Parhama was appointed and changed to the good.
It called it 'cultural, mentality and physical change'.
In London, we did not invest as much work as it is now.
We have changed absolutely everything.
The outcome of the day is the outcome of the first half of the nearest side with the finger at the first half of the first half.
India's game was launched without hanging in its own account, but their sample was very tight and kept a minimal result 0: 1 until the end of the third period when the gates were repeatedly won.
She put up a bomb in the championship in the queue of the countryside, looking at the middle section of the square and to broadcast a bomb attack by means of the Americans 2: 0.
In the fourth quarter, Melisa Gonzalesa scored only one minute.
This was the game of the first US Vulner-up Guard, Bruges in Bruges, each of the first three games.
She has come.
And, as it is, Bama.
"We'll be very fine at the moment," said Saxama, but how exactly it will show a game on Saturday.
The lest of the depression period is the 'Intelligent malt'
In March 1933, shortly after his election, at the presidential election, Dr Delano Rimfisher sat in the ovour in order to keep the edge.
President Rheil had a splendid gester of fine arts like a gestache blind corner in a fused and Merille armed robber.
But on the day his metal was more modest: the eggs of tomatoes tomato, potato stark and dessert.
James Ziegelmane says: "This is the way to show solidarity with people who were very hard."
Her husband said: "It is also a message for the Americans to eat."
A couple of the Brooklyn Heights district is an edition of edition.
In the last book of Kok the "Profit Down" describes Chinese custodians in America, while Ziegelmane describes the lives through the eastern spiral of Manhetena in its book of 97 asbets.
Their new joint work, which will be published on Tuesday in Harper, is the story of the American Easter during the Great Depression.
By showing a certain amount of solidarity in the culinary, they held the meal together with the reports of Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple set-aside in the Flatyl Division and operate since 1929 when a major depression began.
In the case of 54 years old Ziegelmy commissioned butter and sailed eggs, while 57 year-old Kova commissioned a clean, potato and vegetable juice.
When the reporter sent a fake green, a couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to talk about the medieval of the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmanman told us that the counterfeit green was very popular.
Outside the farmed green, acoted green and seemy green.
They were drafted on the basis of basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
They thought it is - to eat so many land to be half a day.
Mr Kou was wrong.
"I suppose you'll seem to be full with lead," he added.
In the first decade, the American lunch was the head of a Swedish gallery, especially in rural areas.
Women prepare to eat their men and the workers and broke, lunch and dinner were given fresh cores.
In the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans a medieval: the intelligent meal describes how the Americans were adjusting circumstances when America suddenly was no longer overweight.
"At that time, the metal became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," Mr Kou said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on this subject.
It was just as important that the new budget has been flouted: uncertain food, such as the false green and indignation became a daily, indignation was a 'wonderful way of using surpluses', as the pains were able to hide the unattractive substitutes under the shake-up measurement.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which for years was the main element of American malnutrition, now became an extremely rare source of luxury.
At a time when the number of calories and food was more important than taste, born new, yet unknown formations.
In a long-time booklet, Mrs Ziegelmanes found a recipe for paving the finger on the globe.
Mr Kou said: 'It was not a popular complement to lunch.'
Ms Ziegelmans says: 'It was surreal'.
The dry butter and the residue of the cold are not compatible.
Many home-grown recipes applied to difficult times.
households economists like Lusis Stenley, head of the Federal Minister of the Economy of Habitats from 1923 to 1943, set up national eating habits, which had not been experienced before the Great Depression, or after it.
By publishing articles and prescriptions in newspapers and magazines, they were advised by households to become "economists" and to accept challenges such as turning the macaroni and carrot into a mental edge.
'Intelligent Malt 'means a break of historical lengths.
Particularly interesting is the testimony of the attitude of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Hughened, 'let me eat a cure' attitude.
Although he said publicly about his humiliating childhood and catering in Ass, he was actually building a fine million for which he had become.
Mr Kou is telling: 'He was born of Europe's kitchen, for example, with the stock of tired cucumbers'.
He wrote almost in plain the gutter and wearing half a half mile.
He was completely cut out of reality.
President Rehn would have made the same mistake, unless his wife Eleonora would not have recommended the example of his eating habits.
The book tells us that Rheil has been a domestic worker who did not learn to eat, so the White Belt became a place, "where it was not just one of the most flashest meals in Washington, but also the worst of the yarns."
As soon as the country's economy rewards, most depression configurations are rampant.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional value, as well as how to use science in culturally, added Ziegelmanes.
The rest is that when writing books, they gained a greater understanding of the habits of the mother of Ziegelmanes, for example, why she was unable to discard a week.
"She really feared to throw out a little food," Mr Kou said.
Ms Ziegelmans said: 'She actually fightened people.'
There was an incident with wind power.
When we were eating the Eisenberg estuary, the writer went out from the side of the somit home.
"This is a stream of extinction," said Ziegelmans, adding that the habit had been circulating at the time to give us the title.
There is no vacuum, only dried streams, a little farce, sugar, water and sanitation.
Everybody impatiently pushed the warships to the wounded massacre that came to the plates.
It was not so bad as a matter of urgency.
Mr Kou has apparently shed some cumots.
He told the hearing that "the spectacle," he said, had said a wife.
Gilead will receive reimbursement of legal expenses in the fight against Merck on the Hepatis C patent
An open judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive back expenses for lawyers' services it has paid in the case of the crackdown of Hepatis C patent against the pharmaceuticals company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of the 200 million pounds of fines for the success of two Merck patents, threatened with the successful Soros and Harvoni tablets when a US federal judge found irregularities in Merk operations, such as loving following soot transfer and other non-ethical practices.
On Thursday, a US district judge, Beta Citizsons Fmorning, said that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to get positions on the market against Gilead, which is dominated on the market with the new generation Hepatitis C medicine, which is effective in 90% of acute diseases.
The case was launched already in 2013 when Gilead and Merck passed one another to try to obtain ownership of the new active components of Phosphusk, which is the main ingredient of GPS.
The forces supported by the United States claim that the control over the town of Manhoslovakia from the Islamic State has been fully taken over.
The forces supported by the United States were completely overwhelmed by the Latvian border at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldier town has left the town on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Teams (SDS) now wrote the town from the last opponent fighters who have not left the city yet.
They have freed more than 2 000 hostages civilians, who were abducted by militants, told Reuters from the military council of the SDS club.
"At the moment, the city is in complete control and we are carrying militant searches," he told the agency Reuters.
Clinton reached USD 10.75 million in 2015 and a couple of EUR 34.2 percent of the corporate tax rate.
Hillary Clinton announced the 2015 tax declaration, which shows that the presidential candidate and her husband earned 10,75 million dollars in this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent accordingly.
In 2015, Clinton has donated USD 1 million, mainly to its Clinton charitable organisation; the former president Bill Clinton has earned around 5.3 million dollars, speaking as a spokesperson and the former secretary of state secretly issued $3 million in cooperation with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's electoral ally - the US Virgin Army Senate Timet Kevin and his wife Anna Holton announced his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
Hillary Clinton and Timing Kevin continue to set new standards for financial transparency, "Clinton's campaign partner Denifera Zurrici told the statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind different pastures and reservations, so that promises should not be made to discover their tax information.
The publication of the nominal tax information is a recording of the practice of the presidential candidates in the United States, but it is not required by law.
The New York Business Act and his lawyers are referring to the Auditor's audit service audit as a reason for non-transparent tax information.
"Your move," she said in his Twitter street, Clinton's campaign partner Ians Sami told reporters.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Advisor, Michael Kohls, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, claim his refusal to raise questions about his real estate, the amounts of donations and other commitments made by his business, including her obligations with Russia.
Clinton shook the oil fire on Friday, where several influential exiles claim Trump to publish their tax information.
She again came back to this issue during an economic speech Thursday in Mičiganda.
She said: "He refuses to do what the rest of the presidential candidates had been doing for a number of decades."
Politico says that, in the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes at all, and on Friday the author of the New York Times said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a key issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, supporting the proposal of the Vatican Bafesto, promoted the idea that each benefiting over $1 million a year should pay a tax at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week in Clinton's speaking time in Omaha, Neazine, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also present, the Bafesto called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
The Bafesto said that he too was carrying out an audit of the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of the electorate, not tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton has now been living in Chieva, New York and the average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and a total tax rate of some 40,5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's 2015 tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars from their income are alive.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, of which Clinton's dividends have received $109,000.

Jewish film director Criticises the hotel in Berlin on the exclusion of the Israeli washing code at the request of an arsender: the RT report
The winners of the French film promulgated by the Jewish Film Passport broke out a storm in the social media when it transpires that the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin has no access to Israel's televised code: it is justified by the request of the Arab client.
Kickly Lancmann, documentary film about the Holocaust Shoah director, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the town of Kempinski Bristol and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmann tried to find a list of the Israeli waves on the proposed list of the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries which can call directly from a hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been blamed and destroyed?
Writing Lancmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol hotel the hotel to call the country through its call centre.
The regime requested an explanation from the hotel.
Lancmann writes that the answer received "he shocked him."
He explained that "this was a deliberate decision by a hotel steering board."
The reasons for taking a coding were further sanctioned by film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked the Turkish coup," Lancman quoted an explanation of the hospital worker.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said that the Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jakov Had-Handelsmann had called this case a "big shame."
We are astonished and shocked about this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened specifically in Germany is that there is even more humiliation in this hotel network.
Self-explanatory.
The officer said: "We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions."
This event has had quite extensive repercussions on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others consider that the 'Kempinski' hotel has simply eased the Arab customers.
One other recordings said 'Come', pointing out that the hotel is in Kurfurstendamm with a synagoogai street.
Der Spiegel is convened that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all resettlements, stating that it was all "misunderstandings" and apologised to Lancmanam.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the national number list," Sudan deutsche Zeitung cites Kempinski's representative.
And to add that the code is again attached to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas from the protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police collisions were held on Thursday in the city of Sanstoulu in Brazil, where students were watched by the reform of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas to students.
The problems started when the Ombudsman tried to evict students, which resulted in the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
There were several hundred students in Demonstria to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The proposal foresees close to 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be resettled to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators had branched the walls with messages against the interim President Maicago Temeru.
This protest occurred only a few days after the previous protest, when students clashed out with the aim of supporting the replanted president Dilute Routes, who voted through the Senate.
Scotland Yiners of Skiners finishop first, bringing Britain into a gold medal of gold medal
Spot told the tournament of the tournament of the first male counterpart in the last night in the Rio Map, a British team protected his champion as it won the November 2012 London Games.
The 23 year-old sportspeople played an important role in these races, making a proud number of legitimate Scottish Seru Krisu Hou and winning the victorious New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprisingly victory when the Hood won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated that in the World Cup in London, even though Hood had already finished their career.
The problems were the stage between Beijing and the London Olympic Games, because a replacement of the experience of the Lacimia Stafu of experienced start-ups had to be replaced.
They have succeeded in doing this at the last minute.
When Hood went out he was trying to fill in Ki-Emadi and Meta Krampton.
British coaches brought their hopes of the Skills to see their potential, which he later proved.
Hindus, Kenya - champions League and Skiners who installed the Olympic qualifier four years ago, but a better start was the New Zealand team
However, the British trio took gold medals.
The Hindu was in close trouble after his wife, and the Kenyan celled and the Skiners protected this leadership.
The change of the strategy played an important role in the vicinity, because Hindus moved with a higher gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, the seiner to drive faster.
The hospital was watched as a spokesman for the BBC and took over the eyes of Siner, Kenya and Hindesa at a time when they stepped up at a minimum of coffee.
The 23 year-old glass said: 'It was an unspeakable honour'.
I am doing everything to defend my name.
In the film we set the Olympic Record and championed World Championships.
That was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning, along with Kenya and Hou in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindus opera that deliberately collapsed for a crack after the failed start.
Later he won the comment and the British competitors did not have the opposite.
This time, there were no incidents.
Hindus said: 'British flags in tribines referred to London'.
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the Olympic Games were indeed special.
One medals will be writing to a country which won seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the indicator for the success of the team in the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of Hoja, with three Olympic gold medal.
For Kenya, this would mean six wiped gold and one silver medal, while Kenya was born on 23 March (it seems to be the British Sunday, because this day also has been born in Stalin's Sharks, Mo Farahs and Rodman Banisters).
Hood is also born on this date.
Kenya's next station is a springboard beginning today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old sportspeople from Botton said: "I'll quite simply enjoy it at the moment.
Their trip is always the best.
Because it can win with team members.
If you are honest, you won a little single one. "
Hinich said: 'If he gets another gold medal, he should be appointed as a weapon of armers'.
It was the only battle for the medals on this day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlium Vigy, Even Clensiy, Stalin Burks and Oveins Douls showed the fastest period of qualification for four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and phrase will take place today in the second half of today, where the Vigille will certainly be at the centre of the focus.
Yesterday, he had no collusion before his departure, when he was called a judge to size his upheaval.
The Women's trip, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Djoanna Rovsela Šanda, Espoils Barkere and Keith Arčibalda were installed at 4: 260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycle of bicycles will be wiped out in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Faced with the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone is expecting the same achievements in the Rio Group as well.
In the meantime, there has been a wide range of incidents involving charges in sectarianism and dignity, the resignation of the technical director Sheet Conons, and the career is ending by Hood and Victoria Bendlton.
However, when we started the first cycle of bicycle, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Box is becoming uncertain as an ambitious agreement has been stopped.
The future of Aluminium smells and hundreds of its workers in Portland has become uncertain as its chief client has announced the interruption of cooperation.
This communication builds on the plans of the Government of the Viktoria Government to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital to enable the company to continue its work.
The 20 years of subsidies will be interrupted in November.
More than 2000 Alcoa Portlendas factory jobs are at risk.
Up to 2 000 direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
Furthermore, it will also have unforeseeable adverse effects, since the slaughterhouse consumes about 10 percent of all the electricity supplies from the Viktoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the 'Point Henry' battle which led to an interruption of the operation of the AngleSea power plant.
Alcoa Portlendas is working with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation over the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
The factory's energy supplier AGL, supplying energy from its "Loy Yang A" power plant in Latroubes, says that the other three owners will probably cease their contracts.
The majority of the power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia's Joint Undertaking, in addition to the companies' CITIC and the Japanese 'Marubeni Corp' Holding company.
"AGL" looks forward to the continuation of the Portland factory, which would mean a further energy supply slaughterhouse, "he said.
AGL said that contracts were so-called 'risk restrictive contracts', which are due to enter into force since November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month validity period and will therefore be in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in 2017 in the fiscal year, "said the spokesman.
Starting from the likely impact of the 2018 fiscal year, a favourable market outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the future is constrained.
AGL states that USD 187 million has already been estimated to be lost in its forecasts, provided that these contracts will be suspended.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate the treaties will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue the operation of the slaughterhouse or to provide it with energy.
The US company tells us that in 2010, it concluded a contract with Loy Yang on 20 years, but it will be interrupted in November.
Analysts expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland slaughterhouse and the closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, owing to the weakness of the sector economy.
Last week French chief Mikhail Mikelson said that 600 megawatts and Zago 900 megawatt were used in Portland at Portland.
If both plants were to come from the energy market, the demand for energy would be reduced considerably.
This would not be good enough.
The Community legal centre denies 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year and the situation could worsen the situation by decreasing the budget.
Three out of five people in the Kwine leange - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal exhibiting are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overcharged, warns against the fact that the situation will only be worse than the cuts.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have done up to now.
The director of the Cherosière legal centre, James Farrest, said that the newest National Law Entrepreneurship Report says that the current legal aid is being denied to thousands of people in need.
The Mistry Farrest noted that if this decision is not lifted, then the situation will only be worse.
He also says: "The Cwine leel legal centre is chronically underfunded, which means that aid is being denied to thousands of people in need."
People who are trying to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are going through divorce, the families who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousands of Cwine growers will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and the Kwine Senator George Brandisto to immediately stop the cuts in funding so that people who need legal aid are able to obtain it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the average national level.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to invest the Palazčuka government in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign has been brought to court, as one of the workers dissolved the firearm.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been brought to court because they did not take action, receiving information that the head of the North Carolina operations opened a firearm against a worker when they travelled in the same car in February.
This incident was described in a court's request submitted to the Court of Justice on Wednesday, by a Vaculator Bordini, a former campaigner for campaigning.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months to start the case, but it was understood that this would not happen.
The leader of the Philippines "disappeared pistols, put his fine finger on the meat and opened his knee against the knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that, when submitting complaints to local and regional campaigning, Bordini learned that at least four people had experienced the same.
"The arms do not need to be shot in order to cause losses," Bordini said in his complaint.
Only two days before submitting this dossier, the Republican candidate was a scandal to announce people that "Second amendment people," i.e. weapons owners and enthusiashoods, could be dealt with if his group Hillary Clinton and his elected judges win his election.
Trump's campaign said that the media had broken his words from the context and he never had any action to violence.
Bordini would prefer to recover the compensation from the organisers of the campaign for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines, on the use of the attack, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
The Trump spokesman Houpa Hiksa did not comment immediately.
We have failed to contact the Philippines.
WCCB - the host home news agency reported that the Philippines has recently abandoned the campaign.
Nor have it succeeded in calling on his advice firms' Innovation Consortitious Services'.
Donald Trump's presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - a paperless and sport blew in cattle.
On Saturday, for the first time in Ceuta, the people brought together on a carpet and a blessing of sport.
After the celebrations of ten years, this time it was decided that the Ezer festive will no longer be.
A new page has now been exceeded.
The day started with sporting competitions.
This time the contest was not traditional and too serious because, for example, the horses had to be met in the guest target, the horse flight, with the man's hand, 'bumboarding' has not been at all the same Olympic Games.
Every member could, however, show how strong, courageous, good and attacker.
After sports games, everybody pulled out in the boat where the blessing began.
In the meantime, the 'chilled corner' has also been working, where the little could have been put into the tracks of the effort and to acquire new images of images in the Georgians.
A new one, which could also become a tradition, was the debtor's debt in which both tractors and motorcycles went up.
He said that it was not enough to have a lot to say, but it was not a great obstacle to the dark rest and dry matter.
The storms continued with the slight of the younger population of Cheil.
Indeed, it is good that the order has been accompanied by five girls and one night.
The carpets were the prey of amateur sports clusters from Endores: the spectators were very pleased about the premises of the "Rudens rites," the eyes of the different peoples of the "Reda" and "Golden Bucharest" of young people.
It's nothing for the wet to smile in one year.
Naturally, local people and their villages were delighted with the famous actor Yanis Jaran and Dainis Porganism, who once again had a Mild Pole and a clear wife of the man who had been found by the man of the man who was sitting off the day.
"It's all right."
Britain must keep the Olympic flame and expand Hittrova.
Hittrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, I believe, makes Hittroit very attractive, just as in 2012 in London, where we invested a tremendous job so that all the country's regions benefit from the Olympic Games.
The dispute and yes won a huge amount from the Olympic Games.
And we will do this once again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Hizures.
Local communities alone will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and will finally put an end to the unemployment of young people in Hishops.
Just like London Olympics in 2012, this time will be people who believe that this challenge is too high and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people were saying that Britain will never succeed in preparing for the Olympics and that it will be a global failure.
Skeptists were wrong for 2012 and, in the case of Hishops, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hittrova has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Heztrova is an infrastructure project that benefits society as a whole and not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating soil for both employment and experience in this airport and across the UK.
An excellent team has been working in Chapt, which has created a 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme, within a timeframe and budget, from a terminal 5 to five years from the site as the best airport terminal in the world and finally to a terminal 2, built between the two most intensively exploited motorways in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the expansion of Heztrova.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and broaden Hittrova, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Niton is a member of the Hittroit board and former Secretary of State for Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman went to a great path, trying to make suicide.
Outside the night, the night was on the road.
Police are trying to find witnesses in an accident when they moved across a number of machines on Thursday morning from morning to a superior.
The accident happened on Thursday after midnight on the A1 route near Morges in the town of Vo cantonen.
The Vo Cantonian police report says a desperate desire to commit suicide, a woman had learnt in the dark where several cars passed him.
Clearly, by trying to kill themselves, victims, 49 years old ushers, drove several cars, including heavy machinery.
She died at the scene.
Many of the drivers involved have already given evidence but others involved have not yet been ascertained, says the police, which calls for the involvement of the drivers involved and the accident witnesses.
The case has also started a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, an opportunity for the Le Tribune de Geneve, a lawyer, Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
He added: "This will be a clear prosecutor."
Two similar cases, which have taken place in the last 5 years, show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, a pedestrian-night had moved on the road, so it was decided that the drivers cannot predict that the night on the roads would come to a pedestrian, a textbook.
Last year, a policeman was justified in killing behind the snout when she passed a man in August 2014, who slept at A1 near Passes in mid-August 2014.
The Court found that 22 years the victim had drank and had later noticed to get to the road.
The Court concluded that the police officer, who was on the road to the place of an accident, was in an appropriate form and the judge recognised that he was a "completely unpredictable and exceptional case" on the road.
Anyone with information on an accident near Morales on Thursday calls for contact with the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The Internet collects the signatures of a new head of the Revenue Service.
Assistants' Avaaz.org, a new Member State for the organisation of the post of a new government takeover service (SRS).
In a petition addressed to ministers from the National Alliance (NA) and the Greens / Farmers Union, the public wants a transparent and professional profile.
The petition was set up on 10 August and it is currently being signed by 55 people.
The nomination process of the Revenue Service's master UCITS is intransparent and unprofessional.
It cancels the functional traditions of the best Soviet Union.
This discredit public administration and once again puts the public on board in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be evaluated by all candidates," the text of the petition.
Its author, Janis B. stated that the criteria are not known to the public, such as the chosen position of Kolegova.
Nor can it be clear what the candidates entrust to the Revenue Service.
It says that a new, open competition involving professional candidates, personal selection specialists and appropriate remuneration is actively promoted by the National Chancellery.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola formally nominated team leader of Kolegova last week, this week the government voted against him in his new position, but all party unions voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, so I played a bad job.
"It is not enough to have any difference in the number of tourists," he said.
One of the world's strongest beaches vodder on Thursday at the top and decisive game with 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 15, 7: 15) lost the Brazilian Evanvictim Gonsalvest Oliveira and Pear Solberg, concluding his participation in a four-year critical sports forum.
In three sub-groups, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The following three points of mutual small paragraphs were included in the pipeline, which, after this mascent, the most unfavourable loss suffered directly from Latvia's dueth.
"In the first six we were under the lead, but from 16: 15 were also on 16 points," Sun was remembered for the game.
Even I do not know how the remaining part of the sixth left untold us.
It must not play.
Afterwards, after the second six, everything was in order and was able to laugh up a game in a seated head, and it should also have been a good foundation for the third six.
We did so like this, but after we changed the parties, the result is only one team.
We had too many errors in attack.
In the Sub-group all teams were similar, almost all the campus were three faces, so small points were important.
"I wanted to play in a more awful, not several times, 3-4 points in a row," she said.
We knew there can be a sergeant.
"In the first six months, we saw 1-2 points in the second time, while the third to + 4 already went to him," St Petersburg said.
We tried to show the best game.
I was drunk, laughing at the moment.
The situation of the common assessment before the massacre was not watched, but it was known that as many small points as possible were possible.
"If you lose, so I played bad," Samoilovs said.
From Evange, we waited a good sergeon and I did so well in the first six months, while the third party opened up and it was difficult to have an attack.
On the other hand, I received a great deal of wrong with Peat serves, but it had to be dealt with.
The Samoiloov said that, contrary to the previous match today, sportsmen were not vocal.
"We saw, we played, including protection, but there was a better place to be accommodated," he said.
"They played a good game and at the end came to the table."
Before the Turning-day he said immediately that the logo was the most inconvenient one could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but did not even get out of the group.
"All of us were expecting medals, but we are not there, but then there are no differences - 25th place or four" said Samoilovs who predicted that dozens will continue to play a part in the future.
I think there will be no question and will continue to play together, because this is just one continent.
Speaking to Samoilovam Rio de Janeiro in Beijing as early as September 2008, in Beijing, he started with the Federation of Machen, but four years ago in London played a game with Ruslanu Sorokina.
Meanwhile, this was the second launch in the Olympic Games.
Latvia's recovery follows the process of opening the gas market as a potential trader.
The Latvian national energy company Latvia is following the opening process for the gas market, both from the consumer and the potential trader's position, said Ivita Bidere, the company's spokesman.
"The decision on whether the gas market will be joined by the trader in the future as a trader will determine what the gas market model and the regulatory framework will be established."
"It is therefore active on their side to engage actively in the drafting and comment of the legislative acts and to submit their proposals," Bidere said.
The BNS has already written to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the Latvian gas company, which will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, ensuring that natural gas operators have the right to freely choose the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
By working on the new natural gas market regulation, the objective of the EM is to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and comprehensible to the user.
For this reason, the most efficient and user friendly solution option selected the "trader's central model" where all activities relating to customer service are provided by the trader, one contract, one billing and one customer service facility, leaving the technical questions to the distribution system operator in terms of distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently in place in electricity trade.
Remember that household customers will have a phased market opening - even after 10 April 2017, household customers who will not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to obtain natural gas from the existing trader than a regulated price, thus becoming involved users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas users for regulated prices is determined by the public trader," the ministry informed.
For its part, economic operators will have to choose an natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, trade in natural gas will be provided for a certain period of time by the natural gas trader on a fixed price.
The draft terms of office of ministers shall set out in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trafficker, system operator and users.
Rules governing the supply of natural gas and cessation of supplies, safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and responsibilities of the trader, user and of the manufacturer of the facility, the size of the trader and the supply of customers in the event of disruption to natural gas supply and the supply of customers to the natural gas supply disruptions.

Minister: The next week is expected to be judged to increase the remuneration of the Revenue Service's Director-General.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers) plans next week with Prime Minister Mars Kucinski (Greens / Farmers) and the government coalition partners to talk about increasing the remuneration of the National Revenue Service (SRS).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Revenue Service's Director-General needs to be addressed urgently to make this office more attractive for potential candidates.
It is also about changing the conditions for tenders next week.
The minister also underlined that she had no specific candidate to address the vacant post.
At the same time Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Kolegova, head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good director of the Revenue Service.
On the other hand, according to Daci Pelfeko, Chief Executive Officer of the Revenue Service, who expressed their readiness to claim this office, the minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the Revenue Service should be "sick of the ground" and should not come from the Revenue Service's structures.
She went on to say that he is expected to return to Saeima from the leave, in order to guide the amendments necessary for the reorganisation of the Revenue Service as soon as possible.
The BNS has already announced that the head of the Public Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova Minister for Finance, Denmark, submitted an application to withdraw its nomination as Director General of the Revenue Service.
In his contribution, she said that it was not an easy choice but, in the last two weeks, her friends have experienced serious emotional pressure, although there has been no condemnation of the law.
Kolegova pointed out that the consultation of her candidature has multiplied the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.

Oil prices are continuing to increase; there is an increase in the exchange index of the US and in Europe, as well as the value of the US dollar.
The oil prices in the world today continue to increase, with the positive influence of investors in the statements made by Saudi Arabia, which are reinforcing the expectations that the largest oil winning countries in September will take action to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main US stock index on Thursday reached a record level which had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indices of a number of big companies.

The turnover of the producer of the Spanish manufacturer 'Blue Belt' last year has fallen by 33. 8%.
The total turnover of the producer of the "Blue Belt" manufacturer last year was EUR 4,202 million, which is 33. 8% less than the previous year, while the company's loss decreased 5.7 times, to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the financial statement issued by Lursoft.
The company's management report says that in 2015 the company worked with losses resulting from a number of reasons, including the permanent redeployment of funds caused by Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, leaving the Kaplagne to closed contracts without any chance of fulfilling them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient means to buy cheaper raw materials on a larger scale and to receive a rebate.
The transfer of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also banned companies from implementing support projects from the European Union's Structural Funds, which would have allowed the plant to buy new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Likewise, the company's financial generators in the driving year had a negative impact on the price increases in raw materials and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the products they produce.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognised price changes and were prepared to buy goods for new - higher - prices," said the company's leadership.
In 2015, the Blue Film opened discussions with potential investors, including the rating of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been the largest creditor of the company Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have studied and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the operation and development of the company had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimum plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan brought together the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, enabling more productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"A number of installations producing higher production speeds were purchased," said the company's steering.
The "Blue Film" management notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's manufacturing site to deliver orders which had not been possible until now.
The first production party that will be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As their intention to sell the product has already been signed, all manufactured products will be sold in accordance with their intention to record them.
The new product increases the turnover by around 300 thousand euros a month, "said the company's leadership.
The company is also planning to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish to Iraq in August 2016.
"In 2016, the first experimental container has been sent to Israel, extended the market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement in September this year with a new supermarket chain in the US.
As a result of all the aforementioned measures, the company intends to increase the turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Four worked with EUR 6,347 million for turnover and EUR 5.113 million for losses.
The Blue Belt is founded in 2017 and its capital capital is €1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private individuals - Gbacano (89, 11%) and Igor Schircus (10. 89%).

The visit of Zar Lendeavours at the crossing-house Rta, which was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was the fate of the Riga Dar in 1924, because it was precisely because she found the unconventional light of the Lar Leandemy woman who tried to hit the theatre from the theatre theatre.
Perhaps it was the accidental grey in Riga, becoming a fatal corner for the creative way of the world, in contrast to the world's glory.
Riga Diego Leandela had a warm memory and she hoped to come to Riga in Riga, but unfortunately, these expectations were not condemned as the Second World War began.
It will be possible, through a reprimand form, to be possible in Riga festival 2016 and the great Hurvica role played by Cathodog Leandeyer.
There are certainly wide traffic restrictions on Aglonas.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants in the viceless New Mari Debee, from 12 August to 15 August of this year, the transit traffic for trucks on a number of national motorways in Aglona will be closed down by the Latvian state's roads.
The restrictions on Aglonas blew and public transport will not meet these limits.
It has to be borne in mind that a motorway at the P62 clearance station in Preami-Madona (0,80-4,00h00 km) is carried out by construction works and will only be able to cross the public transport and pedestrians during the award of Aglonas.
For other road users, traffic will be delivered along the road map - the Scheme accompanying the scheme.
Traditionally, a large number of actors are arriving on these sows, including pilots.
Therefore, motorists should be particularly careful, because there will be intensive pedestrians on the roads along the road routes for Aglonia.
We call on drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions imposed, to comply with the traffic organisation regime and to count on a possible longer period of time.

Because of the break-up of the Neighbourhood, man is going to be hit by the Greeks and forced the houses to leave.
Dmitrier Saidjazov, whose neighbour painted his capital in his apartment and since then Dmitri from the Greeks didn a discard and no confidence to stay safe.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and have been damaged in my apartment.
Then I informed Riga Construction, House of Commons and other organisations.
The Board of Governors said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
"Liquid owners have to go to the Latvian civil society and there will be an expert," Dmitry tells.
The expert requested has arrived, drawn up and recognised that the cover was in an unsatisfactory position.
However, since the first Prize of Dmitry, it has passed a month and, until the start of this week, it also failed to respond whether or not to live in a position of life.
It is the law that says: legislation, wait, if you are not happy, write for everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote Riga City, but they passed a house manager, then the head manager went back to the construction board and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry tells.
After all the papers of the papers, it is clear that construction works have been halted, while it can be heard somewhere that someone is working there.
Over two months, an expert and a six-month patent holder who arranges repairs has to be corrected by all those defects.
The independent expert has developed its opinion, but the Executive Board regards it as incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal complexity of this non-existent structure has been affected, so it is not certain that the owner of the substandard residential is a threat.
"That's why we have asked for further clarification from this expert," she said.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper house, the construction continues to be heard from there.
The punishment for arbitrary construction without construction permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in a specific case the penalty may be more severe.
As long as an expert opinion is expected, the Board of Governors decided that both apartment must not be exploited, both for construction and for Dmitry's living.
"This is the case that the construction board has not been in practice in practice whereby, in this way, its ignorance or simply unwillingness, the population may not only pose a risk to its own property but also to the owner of the subcontractor, as a result of which the owner is unable to operate its property."
It is now up to Dmitri to find another place where to live - to the creators, friends, hotel or to rent another apartment.
But the losses incurred by the Dmitry can seek to recover from the civilian rule of the neighbour, which can take a great deal of time.
As a result of arbitrary construction, both apartment blocks are currently forbidden until the civil engineer will give its conclusion and may have expected to wait for up to three weeks.
The damage suffered will be borne by the proxy holder where repairs have taken place.
This apartment's owner, because the construction board has not been taken into account, is also at risk of a prison term for up to six months.

NASA climate model: Venera ever was a residential planet
By relying on the latest climate models of NASA, Venera has ever been a residential planet.
The researchers of the NASA Godarda Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore Venera's history by using tools and algorithms, which are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus whose surface is a cartel where there is no water and whose atmosphere is almost exclusively carbon once the earth has been in similar circumstances.
Scientists have already mentioned in the past that the speed of the Venus slowing is explained by the density of the stocking atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation shows that the Venus ever had a plan, a low atmosphere of the earth and has turned slowly.
The model also addresses the former topography of Venus.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on earth, but there have been enough water and geographical diversity to be able to build their lives and prevent the evaporation of water.
In the past, in Venera, the sun was 30 percent in flat.
In simulment of the GISS model, the Venus Greening model reveals that a day's longitudinal share of 2 months was explained in the press pack by GISS Scientist Del Genio.
This process warns the surface of the planet and gives rise to a case which, in turn, consists of frequent cloud layers acting as umbrella, while safeguarding the planet from the voltage heat.
The result is moderate climate temperature, which is in fact a few degrees below the temperature on earth today.
The Modela presents the history of Venus, a similar evolution theory developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Even though it has been inhabitable, the Venera has been subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet ray over a number of billions of years.
Its oceans took off and the coral was burnt by ultraviolet stars.
The water stretches completely out of the glass ceiling of the plan carbon dioxide emitted with deadly greenhouse gases - Venice, what we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venera Climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patriks Roy's departure from Avalanche training
Avalanche's Avalanche's Avalanche's Avalanche's Avalanche and Hockey Operator Patrick Roy complained, as a reason, insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
Colords and head coach Joe Biden confirmed this message and said that the club would start searching for new exercises immediately.
"Over the last three years I'm vigorously, enthusiastic and ambitiously fulfilled my responsibilities as the chief coach and the Vice President of the Colorade of the Kolorade club," he said.
During this summer I have seen a great deal of thinking about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the bright of it and achieve higher levels of results.
In order to achieve this, the main trainers and hockespeople for the victor of operations should be fully coincided with the vision of the organisation.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions have not been met.
On 23 May 2013, the issue that took place on 23 May 2013 thanked Mr Rowe for his contribution to the team.
It was said that the Patriarch told him about his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him well in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche Team in 2013-2014 Roy was recognised as the best coacher and won the award of James Adamsa.
He helped to reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Divisions, while Minesota Hocticists won the club in the first round of the interview with the club, the club has been unable to get a cut-off point for two years.
Avalanche completed the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and five points behind the Wild team, without getting the second special invitation to the West Conferences organisers.
In his career, the leader of the famous drug wiped four Stenley Cup in his career: two with Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
North Sea oil platforms launch talks and postpone the strike
Workers' strikes on the salaries of workers in North Sea oil platforms have been postponed following the resumption of negotiations by both sides of the argument, the heads of the negotiators.
The Periodici versus the Wood Group on the oil treatment plant has been arranged on the North Sea oil platforms operating in the Royal Dutch Shell company.
The joint statement says that Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to reopen negotiations for resolving the dispute.
A series of full days are scheduled to start in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week with a view to revising the issues of concern.
Trade unionists said that their recent events organised after more than 25 years have been targeted against the planned reduction of 30 percent.
Due to the neoliberal market pressure, the Wood Group reduced salaries in the North Sea for 9 percent in the North Sea this year.
Already in 2014, the company has reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explained that additional salary reductions would allow the company to survive the market decline.
Shell has already cut salaries for thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries in order to optimise their work in preparation for a large-scale reunification deal with the British "BG Group."
The energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is even more difficult to leave the British decision to leave the European Union.
At the start of the week, the Scottish MEP, Daivus Anders sons met with representatives of the workers to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea stress plans.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone rather than individual individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost 1.4 billion dollars, compared to USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
The speed of the star of the star boat is to double the start of a star.
The latest Kevin Telelocate mission has helped astronomers from gathering the most full-time catalogue about the speed of the Greek return to a stark.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this star cut off in various fares and how the speed of the Greek turning speed relates to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that we will get more information about the link between the mass, ages and even the history of the wall of stars," World War Caltech Infrasarkano Proceedings and the Analytical Center, Luisa Rebula.
The plea is to be found at 445 tonnes from the Earth.
Many stars in this star only begin to grow, reaching some 125 million years of age.
It turns out with the maximum speed.
Compared with the maximum speed, this growing stars distribute a huge amount of stars wind.
They put their stars on the magnetic field, they are braking the stars.
For stars ageing, their speed is declining.
The captuators are measured at the speed of each stark, setting time between a recognisable starch area, such as the sun plank, appearance.
The latest Greek turning accident shows that more stars come slowly than smaller stars.
Replains compare stars with deceptives, higher fertilisers perform the pyramid lower than small spectators.
The "white" vote shows that cheap rotating objects are bigger and more massive, while the roasted objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that a pleasant stark is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory where the characteristics of the stars can be compared to the speed of the return.
It says that a pleasant stark helps build theoretical models for stars rotation in both directions and younger stars.
We still have a great deal to learn how, when and why the speed of turning the stars and the full process of settling them is slowing down.
Recession and his colleagues have explained in detail the analysis of the speed of the opening of stars to the three new publications, which will shortly be published in the Astronomia Prize.
