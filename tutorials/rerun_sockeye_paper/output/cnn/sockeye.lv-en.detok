New doctors' strike: calls for new protests
The new doctor is calling for their trade unions to enter into a protest in the dispute over the new Treaty.
The UK Medical Association (LMA) is going to ask the Council to support broader protests at the beginning of September.
The JAK considers that ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
The treaty was voted in favour of 58% of all members who participated in the vote.
On Thursday night, a member of the JAK council, member of the JAK Council, says that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and is therefore rejected.
She said, 'With this in mind, the JAK vote has been completely rejected and decided to request new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues. "
In response to the silence of the government, the JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including the first time in NHS history.
After the vote rejecting the contract conditions proposed by the LMA, resigned by LMA, Dr. Johang Malawana, from the post of the LMA.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had made BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary Janremie Hants said that the agreement would be concluded with the English Medics.
Russia and Turkey: Atsacrifices alliance?
A woman who ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to link up and notify the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin welcomes the Turkish leader in St Petersburg, the Turkish leader in St Petersburg, has the impression that this partnership is more needed to Ankara.
However, they were both concise.
Vladimir Putin's hybrid smile looked loudged and did not provoke warm emotions, even in the light of his customary restraint.
On the other hand, Erdogan, Erdogan said at least five times as his "dear friend," he said.
I felt the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve the pre-crisis level, but it will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm gives rise to contradictory feelings.
However, from the radiating of Putin, the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the removal of Russian planes on the Syrian border.
At the time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara that it inspired dunci in the back of Moscow.
It was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring real confidence will be very difficult, maybe even impossible.
From November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, the government's controlled television led by aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were all the culprits.
The most serious was the accusations that the Erdogan's family has profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State controlled Syrian.
He himself, of course, denied that.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg summit is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from a peace settlement is obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was trying to overthrow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also been shaken by the numerous terrorist attacks.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the ban on charterremmers, which typically provide the influx of several million Russian tourists in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russia's hauliers and charter companies are also making a lifeline when scheduled flights are restored.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean.
As long as this week, the national TV provides for a drop in fruit and vegetable prices, as the import of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
According to the local newspaper Vedemosti: 'Turists, tomatoes to us. "
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West, in their view, the weak response to the attempted coup.
You can also see the frustration of the protracted EU accession negotiations and the Putin intervention, which is happy to take advantage of the fact that Turkey is moving away from the West.
Russia's leader has undoubtedly obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Please note that Moscow understands this well, because it is deeply rooted in the fear of the regime in the country.
The summit that took place in this luxury sea cap gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as the analyst, the altered alliance, "the two countries that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated publicly, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements affect Syria, where Russia is presenting itself as a peace media, but in fact, Russia and Turkey are in favour of the other side.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose the information, the two presidents told a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The President of Turkey purposefully avoided the issue of disputes between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of open hostility and potential disasters, where the NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian battleair aircraft, the situation has improved because the two leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
Scottish Royal Banka will no longer be available to non-Scottish customers
The GB will continue to play a supportive role in future, the Bank's Executive Director said.
Outside the Scottish SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Macvans tells the BBC channel in Scotland, that the Bank's brand was associated with the Bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because, eight years ago, the bank almost went bankrupt and it needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, brands of the IRB have been used by experts of the SEVB in order to protect other financial brands of consumers.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the six-pack and ending with Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to put forward other national brands to the fore.
Scotland's Royal Bania will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all references of the IRB, be replaced by NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There will also be fewer private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
The charge was interviewed during the trip with customers and staff through Inverneshan.
He told the BBC Scottish channel: "The SKB will become the brand of our investors and working for our staff, because we are now becoming more than branding banks."
In time the bank became a global branding and the IRB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in our sector and our staff will work with their clients under these brands.
The SCB has already announced that there will be no "Six Nations" and involve various brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our clients?
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we will be a superior bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
Once again we can revive these brands again, so I think that now is the time.
A Frenky Detori won the 3000th win with the first place in Newspaper with horse Predilection
The coachers cork in champagne to two finishing their 3000th finishings in the first race in the race.
French Green Deserts on Friday night in the UK's first place in New Deal on Friday, with the first place in New York.
He achieved this in the wake of the second victory in these events in his home town, with the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old MEP is the 6th Place, who has achieved the horses of scores of results.
He has joined the Seram Gordon Richard Ričardung, Dougam Smitry, Lester Pigota, Leicam Pigota, Lester Pigota, Lester Pigota.
"This is something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newcastle, because I live here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not the Royal Askota, but a regular Friday night with 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Following the victory of the Detori and the Predilection are expected with applause and stroke.
The two wrecks have reached this record in the wake of the crash, Oct 20, 2016 (AFP) - Step Sir Antony Makcos, who has taken a number of retaliation.
Lesters Pigel, Ninetrean was the winner of the career.
The film is one of the best jockeys of today and it is not surprising that he has succeeded, which is only a real success.
He is a spiritual and strong, but his sense of tactics is distinguishing him from other ckeys.
He is a fantastic representative, his enthusiasm and charisma, attracts fans for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, in the wake of a few weeks ago, I said to Frank, that he had won 6 000 wins if we did not take part in the weekend and the big events.
However, it is a real pleasure that the Frenky has been on a regular basis for 30 years in the United Kingdom's race for 30 years.
He is an impressive fitness in the British race, and he is an excellent flaw.
A French Detori noted this achievement with its mark of business: an airport's leap.
Of the finishing wind boat, Frank Detori have been the face of a British bag for twenty years.
This is a full way of adventure.
He has won a number of big races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Askota, and has also survived the plane crash and disqualify for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he was difficult to return after six months' disqualification, but he showed his character, challenging those who questioned him when returning to his best.
And he would be able to take part in the race for some time - Detors said that he would be happy to continue participating in the race to the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismissed Chief Executive Officer, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was unexpectedly dismissed by the leaders of the administration, Mr Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the closest people of Putina for many years.
The 63 year-old politician has been appointed as Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "decided to release Mr Ivanov from the work of the Head of the Russian President 'without giving any reason.
Antons Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino has issued a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972, the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
The Kremlin's homepage (Russian), he later chaired the presidential protocol and government staff.
After his appointment he said to Mr Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the Republic, when drafting laws and controlling your decisions.
Putin on Friday told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his post and recommended Mr Vaino as a substitute.
Is the smiles convincing?
This step is confusing Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet security service.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a public television station, the two men announced that Ivanov designed from office on his own initiative.
But despite the smallets of the cameras, rarely reassured such explanations, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is that the outcome of the struggle for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official statement that the man who was supposed to be an alleged president suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is treated with a great deal of scepticism.
Ivanov tells Putin: "It is a fact that I would like to ask me to put this difficult position at the beginning of 2012, I would like to ask me to entrust this difficult position at the beginning of 2012.
It turns out that I have worked for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously he was Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the National Security Council, as well as Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov took his portfolio.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanova in the five people who he trusted the most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was considered a candidate for potential presidential candidate in Russia as Putin would be unconstitutional.
At the same time, however, another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and after three and a half years ago he returned to his post.
Deep catching of fish in the garden in the city of Banfa
One husband from Banfans is asking for help to find out the conditions that have been shown by the species in their garden in Banfia.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be laughter boxes who have come up with a watershed.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres of the sea, released the fish video posted on Periscope, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimetres of the large fish were caught in his garden.
The crustle of the wine buffer: the bridge is now connected to Faife.
At present, €1.35 billion of pounds are expected to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have interconnected the northern part of the northern part of the crustle and viaduke, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faife.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the construction of the bridge is coming to a close.
The constructed constructed is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support for cables.
At the moment, 1.35 billion pounds of pounds are expected to be completed in May 2017.
The Economics Secretary, Keits Brauns has come to construction and was one of the first to rise to the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Kinebuffer bridge."
In this project, we are seeing an unparalleled civil engineering solution, where more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel have been used in construction.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, bridges and viadukta is an extremely delicate process requiring huge accuracy.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the last phase that will bridge the bridge with Rositu will be flown today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for plotting.
The director of the 4th bridge project, Mr Martin said: "The first link is a very important point for any bridge construction."
In this fantastic project, the first interconnection shall demonstrate the construction of a higher class of engineering.
After the last road section and its connection with the support of the Northern tower, we were left to connect the northern road section of the ground or viaduktu.
This was done in the case of the northern border crossings of the northern influx, 700 millimetres south to the south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, a very delicate operation.
There is a huge amount of 222 metres long, weighs around 6,000 tonnes and it had to be dropped by around 3%.
It is delicate because admission in both directions that worked on the team was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything has gone well.
Simona Bailsa is gaining a gold exercise for women.
Premittedly tension.
It is a disgrace.
Simone Bailx is not all about.
Dynamically slow.
Without an effort, exercises on the beam.
It is insurmountable on the floor.
It is completely irreproachable.
And finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American charter won the gold medal, showing fully the difference between itself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total of 62,198 was a final court superior than the silver medals and her team's thrive Alos Raismanes and bronze medals.
On Thursday, Latvian big-man Simona Bailsa took exercise on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Baym became the fourth Americans in a row that won the best champion and the fifth best exercise, by gradually strengthening its reputation as the best basket of our generation and possibly the best surer in the history of the best basketball club.
When the final result was announced, she displayed in asaros because the long way to go to that moment.
This achievement puts him on the side of unparalleled athletes like the Maiklis Felps, who raised his sport at another level.
Baills have been dominated in its sport in the last three years, with 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling such an excellent, precise and ambitious exercise, that the 1984 Olympic champion Lu Retone called him as "the best exercise she has ever seen."
In Brazil, she was looking forward to the last test where she had to compete with the expectations of her rather than with other sportsmen.
She will be disappointed if she returned to his home in Springham, Texas without gold medals.
Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane, the U.S. Athletes and Alija Raismane, respectively, gold and silver medals in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medals was won on Tuesday, making special headquarters Marta Karolji was deducted in Ballums.
Although Bailsa claims that, in its long way to praise, it was not true.
A part of her career on free movement, which includes her specific acronic transitions, is accompanied by Latin music, which fits perfectly into the street next to the Rio Olympics.
It is no coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still infant and revealed by the mother of the third party of the Eimia Bhutte on a sports trip where Burry's ternity took place, has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost a lot of battles since summer 2013 and the victory series can continue as long as the Bailsa wants.
Although Mustafina has made a little over two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The share of the balance and the free movement - the part of the competitions, where Bailsa will champion his champion, is still ahead.
She brought forward the outcome of 15,433 per cent of the finger and reinforced the lead by 15.933 free movement.
Raismane was swept away, while they were waiting for the results, which was only a formality and she flooded with the dream that she was once recorded in her book book.
The result was a small reprisals for four years' ancient events when she divided the third place with Mustafina, but lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old crew, called the Americans as a "grandmother" raised by convincing leadership.
Following the snow on free movement that cast doubt on her return, she was able to dedicate the air kiss effort.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bays-old Bailx, which she published this week, is already completely different.
Mahajos Brauns, a 6-year-old "crowned" in Filadelphia.
A 6-year-old boat was shot dead in Philadelphia, saying that this is already the second six-year-man who fired in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents CBS Filadelfia, confirmed that it was Mahajos Brauns.
The parents say that Brain was shot several times, including in the circuit, the leg, rock and winter, but there was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother of the Delous Melendeza's story: "His tiny body was simply a bunch of lots."
I cannot believe that.
A little in a critical state has been placed in a hospital and has suffered several operations.
The family is informed that he will certainly recover.
He had to start the first class in a local primary school.
Brown is one in four people who were shot in the town of Jermantany.
Three men were also shot: two 29 years old men and a 32-year-old man.
The CBS Filadelfia report that one of the 29 years old is in a critical state, but the situation of the other two victims is stable.
Kanal says the child was found in the front seat of the car in the front seat of the child, a 29-year-old victim.
The other two victims did not appear in the machinery and the police investigate whether one of them was attacked.
The investigator said the CBS Filadelfia said that he was most likely to be at the shooting.
The carrots of weapons belonging to different weapons were found at the site.
It seems to have been a long shelling.
The two pedestrians were found on both sides of the pavement.
"So there are a number of armed shooters here, who played an active part in the shooting," the Philadelphia polictain Antony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars also have to be done.
No one has yet been detained and it is reported that the police check the records of the monitoring cameras.
A 6-year-old girl was hit by the shooting of a 6-year-old girl, while she allowed her house in the district of Westpouskin.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprits.
Why do we need Simona, Gabon and Lauria?
I call it the Annual Women's Olympic Games for several reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer Olympics since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three light Latlos, Simona Bailsa, Gabon Duglya and Lauria Hernandeza, inspired by many girls of new origin.
People can be proud that the team is also part of the team, which is Jewish and Mecona Kociana, which is Catholic.
Finally, this team is truly representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of the Black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
The best luck for the last four years is an Americans of African origin.
Last year, in Simona and Gabon, took place 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabon Dugago, became the Olympic champion, and America was able to gauge.
The world has now seen incredible exercises by Simona Bailsa, Duglya and Lauria Hernandeza, with unprecedented but meistaric exercises.
On Thursday, she became the fourth American in a row that has won the golden medals in the individual multiple fighting for women.
Her team's thrive led the silver medal.
We have seen the best that sport can give, but the rest of the country is completely different in the rest of the country.
Simona, Gabon and Laury got into the Olympic class in the same way as Aliia and Medalone.
They are the Olympic Attack, as the next Olympic exercise team will comprise only four athletes, and this is the last year of the Marta Karola's last year.
In fact, exercise is a costly sport: the instigators are mainly trained in private light clubs, and are maintained by parents who pay for training, accommodation, travel, formaxes, hotels (coaches, athletes, athletes and their families) and other expenditure.
Most of these scoric clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
The sportspeople in these clusters are accompanied by all their training, and it is expensive and a long contribution to a small families.
Eimia Bwman, Simona Bail and Megija Hainija, Lauria Hernandezas, has trained their athletes since the two girls began to deal with an athletics.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabon and Lauria, cheaper exercise training.
I established my own lightweight organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is in Harlema, and we are offering over 15 000 young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercise, free of charge or at low cost; we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will reveal a branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide young people with the opportunity to get to know this excellent sport.
Vieglatotics develops strength, local and body coordination, as well as taught hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination provides a long life with good health and progress, both at school and at work.
The team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in light Latviticism and fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Alija, Gabon and Medis on the excellent demonstration of "Forest Force" by acquiring the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of the offer of Hanta, young doctors are planning to step up more strikes.
Ministers were hoping to put an end to the agreement on changes to the treaty with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, the Hant has announced plans to conclude a contract stating that NHS is in a precarious state and further delays would only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new treaty, which provides for changes to the conditions of night change and weekend, in order to improve working conditions during hours of non-standard working hours.
Last night, Dr Elanna Makourta, a representative of the new physician, said that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and do not impose on all doctors equal conditions.
Eight weeks until the first new doctor will sign the new treaty, so progress must be made, because there is no time left.
BMA's efforts to solve the problem of the problem has faced a lack of willingness from the government to engage and, in some cases, with total silence.
This has happened in spite of the fact that, even last month, James Hants said that his doors were always open.
Jesremy Hantas must take immediate action, stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do so, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
At the last strike at the end of April, more than 13 000 GRT operations were suspended and 100 000 visits were suspended until the nurses and advisers tried to replace the doctors who had gone through the picket.
Ministers were hoping to put an end to the dispute by agreeing to a treaty change with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate of 54 000 new doctors who would be covered by the new Treaties.
Daniels Mortimers, CEO of the NHS, called for new doctors to go on strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that there is no solution to the strikes, but only increases the pressure on the busiest workers and worries, causes stress and hindrances to patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been talking about the new doctor committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and the other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about borrowers and rapporteurs.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues such as staff deployment, flexible training, additional training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, school-leaving and gender pay inequality in medicine - shows that employers, England health education institutes and the Health Ministry are seriously willing to implement the agreement concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products can reduce the risk of heart trucks on a daily basis.
Thousands of patients, who have been in heart - could treat medicines at 2 pounds per day because the official representatives recommend using them more people and longer.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recalcitrant people with heart problems.
This medicinal product is already prescribed for use within 12 months of heart attack by reducing the risk of revoltric.
NICE renounces the use of this Preparation 4 years after a heart attack, to further reduce the risk of heart attacks on people with cardiovascular problems.
At the moment, however, NHS's NICE recommends to use this preparation for 4 years after a heart attack, to further reduce cardiovascular risks.
Every year, around 140 000 people in England are struck in England and a quarter of them are witnessing a restroke or a stroke.
Hearings and strokes are causing the accumulation of fat in the heart of the accumulation of fat.
If a dam bursts, it may create thromba by blocking the blood flow to heart and triggering a heart attack.
However, if thrombs are removed from the blood wall, it can go further in bloodshed and to block blood access to the brain, causing infarrage.
People who have been in heart are exposed to a greater rehearsal hazard.
Ticagrelor manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, and traded under Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombs.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months and a further 3 years, together with an aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsson explains, Professor Kerola Longsson explains: "Despite the availability of medication prevention, more than a quarter of people who have been a heart attack or stroke, who often have severe consequences."
Fear of rehearse-heart attacks may have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor combined with an aspirine is effectively reducing the risk of reckless heart and heart attacks on people who have already experienced it.
Provisional recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend treatment for thousands of people who are thus winners.
Given the limited information on the efficiency and security of Ticagrelor effectiveness and security, in particular the risk of asleeding in the use of this medicinal product for more than three years, the draft guidelines would not recommend that it be used for longer than that date.
Politcorrectness culture encourages electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfurs Rahman, mayor of Tauern, was dismissed in relation to corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness puts a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
The former Minister of Government Sir Erriks criticized police, election monitors and city councils, that they ignore the symptoms of fraud in the electoral process, since "fear to offend the ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the leader of an anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of the electorate for religious reasons is so prevalent that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at election stations in order to protect frightened voters.
He also suggests that voters should provide an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters have to say only the word and address.
He is even recommending that the voters' votes have been bought with a special thrust in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs also want to provide more protection, says Sir Eriks.
He believes that the press should have more access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud, which goes hand in hand with it'.
The report was ordered in Dauningstrt following the scandal in connection with the election of the city of Tauerhammed.
Last year, the Special Court's court decided to cancel the mayor of Lutfuru Rahman, a mayor of mayor of maybe.
The Court found that Rahman was cynically distorted "the religious vision of its Muslim community and silenced their critics accused of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman has campaigned his election campaign, suggesting that the religious responsibility of the Muslims is to vote for him. "
Around 300 voices were falsified or dubious, as one person had voted on several occasions.
Sir Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly worrying about fraud in a vote by correspondence, where the oldest members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote in favour of candidates.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the identification of identity of individuals.
His report says "Evidence suggests that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the oldest candidates of the community, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is concern that the institutions of the area do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be compromised."
Sir Eriks set out the 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, including a ban on the political activists to operate with votes cast in order to avoid "votes gathering."
The report under the Theresa May also calls for a more thorough review of registration in order to prevent the use of voter lists in the area of immigration and benefits.
To consider the possibility to request voters to present a identity document before the vote.
To mark the voters' votes with special thoughts in order to avoid double voting.
A systematic examination of the nationality of a person to verify that the person is entitled to vote.
To make three years requests for automatic vote by correspondence.
To ban political campaigners and activists from the political campaign and activists to vote by correspondence.
Providing the police the power to post a guard at the polling stations.
To make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
A ban on the photograph of the polling stations.
Reflecting the requirement to use only English (except Wales) to the polling stations.
Increase training to ensure that polling staff go to the polls by one.
Sir Builisk strongly criticises the Metropolitan police, expressing a failure to understand that the people of Tauerhamlet are not prosecuted.

He has been found guilty by the standard of criminal law evidence based on uncontested evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient test of the electorate of the city council.
Sir Eriks said: "Last year's court decision is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the birth of a parliament, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.

Prince buyers are shocked by a woman who is inashamed in the middle of submerles.
Bucharest felt uncomfortable when a woman started to dress in order to keep the bicycle in the shop.
To further aggravate the situation, she said in order to see whether they stand and subsequently disappoint, putting a bunch back on the shelves on the shelves.
She continued to look for clothes, the Folkeston Bouverie Place Trade Centre in the store of the Place Trade Centre.
Primark made Bouverie Place at the Place of the Place in the Folkeston, the place where the woman was subtitled and then put it back on the shelves.
At the moment, a mother of two children, Johng Deividsson, who said that the unknown woman was blamed her clothes and left the shop without opting anything.
She points out that people were unable to believe in their eyes.
In the middle of a parcel, she took a bottle of subbicks and bicks and the on-the-spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where they were to be measured, she was just going on on the ground.
Everyone looked at how she was wouldn't like her, and apparently she did not like them, because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She looked at three more bees until she did not like them and left the shop.
It did not seem to be worried that someone would be looking or advised about the man who bought the clothes that she is going to buy.
The Davidson was told (33 years) from Kenya: 'The idea of a little dried clothes that have broken another person and then not wasted'.
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
The Davidson said: "I assume that the staff of the shop after her withdrawal took place on the shelves from the shop shelves - which are acceptable."
I cannot imagine that they could buy new subparks and find out that another woman has been blessed and then not washed.
Primark pointed out that Primark is known about the incident which took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Certain clothes have been removed from the shelves.
Protecting itself from firearms through Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it slightly safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves with a firearm, we talk to Maga Maga's superb from New York Ronk Maurake.
Whether you are attacking the front or back, this video shows how to protect itself and win over the attacker.
Mexrakes indicate if the attacker is attacked on the back, then the first thing needs to go back to clearly see the attacker and avoid the tip of trajectories.
The weapon must then be shut up and shoulder in the face with his free elkons.
Then there is a blow on the circus and while the attacker obtains a kill, take him a weapon must be taken in front of the gun and resign to the weapon against him.
If the attacker is coming from the front, the situation is similar - the shelter must be shot and should be shot in such a way that the worst cannot shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and take a shot in the hashing and, finally, take his weapon and continue to display him.
Is it difficult?
You see videos to see exactly what Mizrake is doing.
However, you will remember if you do not lie in the Magy's meter, then it is more secure to give the robbery of its money.
The family of Vandals has been demolished by the businessmen's Cornwall's social house and is being put on the street.
The family of Vandals has been expelled from the place of residence for the bullying of the neighbour, causing damage to the social home of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Mr Schone Trebilkok has been put in place in the Kornvolt of the Saltawa, as several complaints were submitted to them.
When they were forcibly extracted from the property, the heated housing service found that property is completely vandalised.
In the morning and in the walls, filling holes had been disposed of everywhere and the walls were picked up with graffiti.
The family has now been extracted from the property and is most likely to be privately owned.
Donna Makevoja, the operator of the Housing Housing, said that there are fears that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She tells us that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live it.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, since in the future, this property in Cornwall will not be of good repute.
This family is famous and their word is well known.
The couple had three sons that have been periodically sued by the police saying that their terror was the scene of violence, outrage in the street, bullying of the local population, drug abuse, drug sales and beautiful bunkering and lamassing of beautiful bunkering and motherhood.
The 47-year-old Skelanders, whose name has been property, has been sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
A number of destroyed home sites found waste disposed of.
A number of floor songs have also been dismantled in a house where the drug traded beforehand.
Neighbours say they are regularly featured on the streets and are constantly being called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service put them out of the forcible of property when they had 11 weeks to be collected on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbours were very happy about eviction because their lives had been absolute.
One said: 'They were not concerned by other citizens. "
We were living in the next 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It is incredible how often we have seen the police.
This morning we could not sleep this morning.
We woke because there was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they have finally left here, it will be wonderful.
Adams Fitzpariks, who is the head of the Cornvolas Housing Office, said that the family was not working with local security authorities.
The family has been living here for 20 years and is regularly called police.
Different old and unusable items were found in the garden in August.
He also said: "It is a great pity that the Irish people did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because it is always the last step that the Kornvola Housing Service said.
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbours had been very serious in their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that the whole of my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and compatriots, who were courageous and collaborated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will ease the lives of the neighbouring and show that anti-social behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatriks said that all three sons here were living in different periods of time, but all over 20 years old.
A dirty hair left at the floor in one of the room after being put out.
The staff of the service will now have to cater for the wayside left in the mother.

Only be found guilty of the storage of Class B drugs with a view to distributing them.
She insisted that the money was earmarked for her son in Le Shelpled, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being hunted, it has become known that they are renting a private property in the Plimue.
Many of the walls were graffiti.
The political message is that they will continue to oblige tenants who violate their rental agreements.
The police spokeswoman Andžela Krova said that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to infringe the rules.
She also said that "this is a warning to those who believe that they can behave like and will have no consequences."
The police in Devon and Kronvolas is not acceptable to the police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give an impulse to the economy.

President, who stayed in the shadow: Gustavam Zemgalam - 145.
On Friday 12 August, the 14th anniversary of the birth of the second Latvian President Gustavs Zemgale.
A Zemgale proclaimed Latvia's country, but is unworthy of the very high profile of the first Latvian President of Latvia's President Corakh and the pre-war period in the last presidential term.
No one of our statesmen has championed democracy and the rule of law as Zemgale, a decade ago, Arnold Auzins.
In a conversation with the Delfi portal, Avanins emphasized that the Zemgale is one of the few senior politicians who have had a sense of humour.
Others are always very correct.
He teaches that nowadays it could be similar to that of Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was close to the people," Auzins said.
Today's politicians have been badly aware of history, they referred to Mr Kārli as a good leader, but seldom knows how unhappy he was.
The only person to whom he was not in the knife was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smile, he was hysterical.
"Look with his sense of humour and democratic," said Auzins.
Professor Aivars Stranga, Professor Aivars Stranga, the Faculty of the University of Latvia, Aivars Stranga, with the 'Delfi'.
He also noted that the Zemgale has taken on the dignity of minorities, has consistently called on Jewish representatives to the President.
"At that time, it was not normal, following the Greek Presidency, Albert Kgusis was taking over this tradition," the historian said.
He was a silent and weighed man for whom he had long been able to talk to him as president.
He did not aspiration for himself, simply did not pay.
He was also rather critical of the fact that he did not know the French language, but he thought he was absolutely necessary to understand it.
"At the time of the Presidency, the French language was taught," said Stranga.
The Zemgale did not allow me to speak again, he did not get it very high.
In all respects, he was a very respectable personality in Latvia's history, as he was very demanding in the presidential palace - he was very demanding a notary.
The Zemgale was led by the famous Zemterminal Tasi Sharrova on the streets of Suvorova, the Latvian state was in practice in government talks in Latvia.
He was always advanced.
It was not a great fan of Ulmaa, but he did not comment publicly.
"Private talks have sometimes said that the behaviour of Ulmaa did not simulate him," Stranga said.
There was no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How do you remember today?
It is a pity, but a large proportion of him associates with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat.
"She did not have any major upheavals, meaning that he could associate with a real stable Presidency," Strang said.
The visit to Sweden from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's country's visit to Sweden, which implied Latvia's full recognition in the neighbouring country and the inclusion in the North European family of democratic nations.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgale came to the country on 28 May 1929.
The visit to Latvia of the Swedish King Gustava V was held on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian President born in 1871 was born in 1871, but in January 1939.
Simple ways to help the child to cope with anger slowes.
I am often confronted with the fact that parents are considered to be wrong and abnormal.
When a child shows their anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" points out psychology Jekaterina Kesa.
Specialist reactions to these natural and human feelings - anger and rage, which is periodically experienced by everyone.
Agressness - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults, we are angry, alarmed - we usually know what is happening with us and how to deal with it.
We can throw our anger and nuts on ourselves: to say, suppress, hide, stay in the face, to tell our friends or other loved ones, we can praise the thoughts, to praise the cigarette (that is not the best way of dispersing anger!), go in duts, thrown up and do other things that are not always done.
We are neglecting our aggression against others, because we know the different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are looking for anger, do not understand what they are going to name them and how they live with them.
They can say, 'Ej away,' You're a fool, "Slikta mamma," 'You see you', 'I'll do you with you' - and very rarely when I can say: 'I'm angry. "
Children are living in literally, they are completely here, at this moment they are spontaneous and truly showing their feelings, and often find different emotions.
It is very important that parents are not forbidden to show feelings, including anger, not to be ashamed of it and not, but on the contrary, to help the child.
Is it necessary in relations?
A long working day in which everything has not taken place as you would like or simply bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to have a day, day or even longer 'to switch from all over the world.
Is it possible to have relations and to breathe a little for a moment?
Or, however, it shows that each of the partners can go?
In my opinion, we are divided between different ages.
Jānis (23) is short and succinct: "In my view, if you need a passport, you do not go with the right man."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has revealed a scheme which may be helpful.
If you feel that a partner is beginning to fall to the nerve for each smallest detail, then surely it is the right moment to investigate other hunting fields to understand whether you are missing him or not, or even if he does not want to see him any more whatsoever.
So the answer is, yes, withholding it can save time and understand how important you are the second half.
Kaspars (29) reveals its theory.
In my opinion, we need to get a passport on each other's daily lives, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the dispute is inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I am doing every detail that the other is doing, and it is starting to go to the nerves.
People are beginning to pick up each other, especially if there is no longer any talk about what you have done in the day.
My personal experience makes it think so, so I have not held relations for more than a couple of months.
If you think sometime about the fact that somebody else or the other is better - then why is this woman with whom you do together deserve something which can think that it is not good enough and behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is already a low betrayal.
If not, then there is no.
"I have, therefore, a little fine for those who are not '.
The Carter (33) is a completely opposite view.
It seems to me that everyone needs space.
You could not have every moment, all the time, from morning to night to watch each other in the eye and pushing the nepalling love.
Reppies!
There are so many things - friends, jobs, ballos.
Everything has its own time.
Of course, friend or wife, but if both are able to keep the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the grave of the graves.
That and only it.
Mārtiņš (27) says: "It is hard to say, whether or not they may be taken, but one thing is clear: its proponents do not have anything to do with it."
If this issue is raised, then there will be some changes in the near future - to the good or bad side, it depends on ourselves.
I think that, while you are still a young and trak, there is still a need - albeit at all times, but when everything remains seriously and the relationship is going into a completely different phase, then no question can be.
You are going to spend all your life together.
"If you cannot withstand each other's society now, and then we need a breathing space every time, then what will be when you are pensioners who comment on how chips or controversy about where a daily horter needs to be better dealt with," said Kristaps (19).
All the words have been changed.
With its enthusiasm and enthusiastic personality, Rozental first waked the Latin people's interest in performing arts.

German researchers are discussing the number of "the victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the communist yoke may be much higher than previously, but doubts about the actual number of victims is still not dispelled.
According to the findings of the Berlin Wall Museum Museum of Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with Western allies and the subsequent Communist authorities of West Germany, who have attempted to escape from their controlled territories.
Museum has been studied for years and periodically corrects the number of victims.
This year, further 11 deaths have been added to the list this year, including among the victims, a six-year-old boy who drown into West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall, there is also the deconserters of the Soviet army.
"The final damage caused by the double jeopardy of Communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," he said.
"Our task is to ensure that the masters of persons who died in an attempt to escape from the Communist state controlled by the Communist state.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure in 1841 is unconvincing," said Mr Johhl, an expert in the East German Free University's East Germanship, Johnson's history of East Germans.
He, together with other members of the Berlin Free University, are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and have so far succeeded in confirming only 260 cases.
In the past, the researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by the Berlin Wall.
In view of those people who have died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to get the West through the neighbouring countries, according to the latter, the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However, it is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of victims could be different methodologies.
Mr Checkpoint Charlie museum also counts all suicide bombers, whether they were directly linked to their service.
The Museum also counts fatalities not related to direct violence.
"Hillers aged between 70 and 80 died after breaking with border controls died from a heart attack," Hildebrante, "he said.
However, Stott is convinced that a distinction needs to be made between the old people who allegedly died as a result of the treatment they have experienced and those who have been killed by a long waiting time at the border.
Regardless of its casualty records, as the authorities of the Communist East of East Germany did not gather such statistics, and researchers should have their documents translated into the various archives of the various types of archives.
However, the Shnow group has recently followed new documents and, in the near future, it could come up with an estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF president Pone to Rio with coach accreditation; it is surprising.
In the last few days, the notorious Latvian Pelze Federation (LPF) President Kaspars Pone in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in the last few days.
In the wake of the Olympics, Mr German Jakubovska, who said that he was going to go to Pone at the Riga Rio de Janeiro, who said that he was going to go to Pone in Rio while coaching to stay at home.
At the initial list of the driver's list had been approved on the list of drivers, and Uvis Kalnins, coaches Jakubovsky and Deivus Collins, as well as the federation president Pone.
The Latvian Pellow federation told the Olympic Games and, even before the departure, Aldons Vrublevávskis claimed that Germans would be and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently, for objective reasons he was not," he said, expressing the view that it did not affect the outcome of the Ribakow's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvja coach took to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the LOW Executive Committee, strongly criticised the functioning of the LOW, bringing the blame for the organisation of the Olympic sport.
In my view, it is unethical to confirm five persons and refrain from carrying out any of them.
"I do not know why the Federation of Pellow did not have any room," Pone said that the work of federations and their presidents are not being paid by the president of the federation.
Pone criticised Jakubovski, saying that, before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not confirmed between members, he appealed to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any sportsmen.
He was unable to tell him why he was in the Olympic Games with a coach accreditation, which is likely to have to be due to Jakubovsky.
"The By was put forward as a federation president (" team leader "), but for unknown reasons, the accusation and now nowhere intrusive."
The situation changed every day, the number of accredited accreditation changes.
Until the last moment I think Germans will be, because I did not have any other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a couple of days before the Ribakova kick had a conversation with the Poni and after the bathers had been with tears, but the LPF president himself said that it was a daily conversation with her willingness to take athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five sports forms part of the Olympic programme and four of them are training children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that it was also very important in Latvia, and also for the programmes he spoke about, in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the federation's work and said that in 2018 the World Cup in 2018.
In Rio de Janeiro is not my leave, I am working, I spent my time and try to implement the four-year programme.

Trenera's fight against cancer inspired Helena Glover and Heteri Stanley in the winning competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medals in these races and it is already doing a lot.
Between the first to the last round, the Helena Gloures and Heteres Staningas gold was a particular part of Estacio da Laga.
Although the boat is only the two sportspeople, they have been accompanied by Robin Viltsa, who inspired them to the second Olympic gold medals for women, becoming the first women in the history of British sports who have made such progress.
They were undoubtedly dominated because they got them in an unparalleled victory, an unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with the sleeping eleganci drove down the water surface, does not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each of the gold medals, there is an entire team that works hard to improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success by a coach, who was not aware 30 months ago, was not aware of whether or not to get the day, because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it was.
I had a cancer cancer, which is one of those that can and should be operative.
If not, it would spread over the whole body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes the vision of the tastes.
Cancer Cancer was opened in December 2013.
It went to this trio that William may start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 interim season and reduce the length of the break down to a minimum, if you can say.
I needed income, so I was quick to recover.
This stimulated the recovery.
I was in hospital and I went to 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, even though the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
All of this began.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first idea was immediately about William, who had been very worried about the whole morning, and the alarm was more than usual.
The Standing Street Artillery unit in Afghanistan said: "This was an emotionally tough week, but it means a great deal for me."
It only confirms how much it means and how many I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years of the Hely and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine better training members or better training.
Helena Glover and Hetere Standing has not lost any race within five years.
The couple achieves such a huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to come closer, the dominance of Staningas and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helena knife: "Keeping rolling stock, keep pace."
It is really important that we do not lose focus.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we did not have the intention to overthrow the record, but simply to rock and win the race and that we did.
A couple of years will be resting to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the champion of Glover and television in the next month.
For the time being she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competitions.
That would have been too much pressure.
I needed about six months in London to understand that I am the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very anxious.
This time it needed about four minutes.
She said: "It is fantastic."

Kolegova as head of the Revenue Service. "
According to him, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens / Farmers) and Finance Minister, Danana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers) is already 'crucial' for the appointment of the Revenue Service's deputy director Kolegova.
Rajevskis has estimated that both Kucinskis and Reiznie-Ozola, in this government, the approval of the Revenue Service's leader is the 'first big decision', which could affect him as a political future.
If it is now going to change its position on the choice of the candidate for the position of the candidate for the office of the Revenue Service, it will have a negative impact on their imidity in the public administration.
On the agenda of the next meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers on the agenda for next week's meeting of the Cabinet of the Revenue Service's Director General, according to the government's agenda.
Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola was channelled by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola, following the resignation of the Officer Petersson, and when the vacancy of the Deputy Director General of the Revenue Service led the vacant post of the Revenue Service.
Dace Peleka on Thursday, 11 August, Latvian Radio was admitted to Latvian Radio on Thursday 11 August - if she would be offered a candidate for leading position, she would be able to agree.
The Finance Minister later acknowledged that no other candidates for the Revenue Service's head are not considered for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, head of the Saeima group's Saeima group, said he continued support for Kolegova under the auspices of Kolegova.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit was jeopardised by the failure to set up a government.
A month ago, the European Commission (EC) issued its opinion that Spain and Portugal did not take sufficient measures to limit the level of the deficit to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the euro area.
Calculations show that, despite the austerity measures taken, the Portuguese budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5. 1% in Spain.
The European Commission decided, however, not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, together with fiscal targets for the next time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against both countries, is the growing Euro-scepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only add to this negative sentiment.
Critics point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, by agreeing on common rules and then unable to apply them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jenx Veidmann said that Europe is losing faith in itself by giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are pertinent, not binding.
The EC has now been proposed by the EC and endorsed by all the Member States until the end of this year, Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission is promising to check the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial projections suggest that the target set for Portugal could be achieved in due course, and this year's budget deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government needs to implement an austerity package of 0. 25% of GDP.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on the control of the procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4. 6% next year to 3. 1% and in 2018 to 2. 2% of GDP next year.
In addition, consolidation measures must be at 0. 5% of GDP every year in the next two years.
The fact that, for eight months, the Spanish political parties have failed to reach an agreement on the formation of a government, and it is becoming increasingly important that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections in a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political scene of the political scene would not change significantly in the country.
The Popular Party is still the party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, whose election would again win over 33% of the votes.
Only the socialists have shielded a little more than the Socialists, while the anti-competitive party in Podemos, or 'Together we can' and 'Ciudadanos' or 'Citizens' popularity has somewhat diminished.
The People's Party wants to get the socialist and Ciudadanos to the government still this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the 2017 draft budget.
As the representative of the parliamentary faction of the People's Party, Rafaels Hernando, if the government to establish a failure and parliamentary elections will, however, be held for the third time, Spain will become a mockery of Europe as a whole.
The purity of the pyramid in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After the fifth anniversary of the beaches, the activists have concluded that, unfortunately, there is still an increase in the number of discoveries each year, mostly bathing visitors.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
The Capitals of the Heart know that bathing sites have been assembled on a daily basis, but it is difficult to combat the dirty visitors.
In addition, dried waste in torrential rains may be infiltrated in water, thereby damage its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain sites in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches in Latvia is critical.
This is the message this week has campaigned on "My own sea."
For the fifth year, the road along the Gulf of Riga, the activists concluded that the number of waste left to every hundred metres has risen.
Regrettably this year, it has become a critical point of criticism this year.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste to the beach 100 metres may even exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulry, spokesman Janis Ulry.
The Latvian Radio, he was in Spain's beach, where a voluntary move along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, among other municipal waste and the pallets of picks have had to collect the fluorescent lamps left in the seabed.
The voyage and the organiser, Ulme say, is the people who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beaches themselves, since more than half of the total waste is plastics, different waste, from bags, plastic parcels that are already depleted, are no longer able to identify and smoke, bottles, bottles, crushers.
Best beaches include bathing sites in Riga.
For example, in Daugavity, for example, almost 800 units of waste that are critical.
The organisers of the campaign are also telling you that you are going to have smoke-free and no warning signs stayed everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites together - Daugavity, Yearbuems and the Residers - are sadly going large and far beyond what is being desired or ambition, to which Latvia is heading to reduce the number of units of up to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender said.
In Riga, the cleaning of Bathing sites in Riga runs weekly, even twice in the summer recess, said Uz Vidausky, the spokesman Ugis Vidausky.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is very difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"On those who use alcohol, smoking and doing all the things that may not be, even a special mark," said Vidausky.
Therefore, it calls on bathing visitors to report on polluters also for the police.
Police can be called a police, you can safely point out these violations and, in this way, to everyone.
Perhaps any new warnings may be levied but, as I said, hardly as a radical change of the situation.
"As everyone simply needs to turn out and be intolerant towards such offenders," he said.
In the meantime, the measurement of water quality has been carried out for the fourth time this summer, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality everywhere is good and satisfactory.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing areas the quality of water has been good at all and there is no restrictions on bathing.
"For the last time we will take an analysis at the end of August," said the Senior Environmental Health Officer Normunds Kadiķis.
In the course of intense rainfall, waste seed can be infiltrated in water.
This in turn may affect its quality.
Roads in Russian elites continue: changes in administration of Putin.
I was left out of office?
Vladimir Putin has announced Russian media that Sergei Ivanov to leave the post himself and will continue to be a Special Representative for Nature, Ecology and Transport.
By announcing the changes, Mr Ivanovs, in front of the TV cameras: 'Amid Sergej Borisovič, we are working together with you for many years and we are doing it successfully. "
I am satisfied with how you fulfil your responsibilities.
I well remember our agreement not to use you as head of the President's administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I am aware of your desire to change the scope of the countryside.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is pointed out that the administration of the presidential administration is a very important position and made Ivanov as one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming Duma elections in Russia next month, rumours were rumoured that this step involves the struggle for power on the political elite in Russia.
Mr Ivanov was also known as a possible substitute for Putin as a substitute for Putin, so the claim that he wanted to take the position of a representative of the president on nature and transport, has cast doubt.
According to Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the GB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a winter and close to the allies of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He launched his own Laughter in 1974, where he was acquainted with Putin.
Later, Mr Ivanov became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed as secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, the "Information Security Doctrine" was approved in the aftermath of the Putina's coming to power, which included in Russia the revitalisation of national censorship mechanisms.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Russian Defence Minister, but since 2005, as Prime Minister Mikhail Fkin and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after the departure of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain their place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President of the President, Vaino will also work.
The picture comes from the family council elite.
Ivanov, the post of President's administration, Mr Ivanov himself said.
We have a long time known with Antonu Eduardovizi.
Then there was the time when you worked on the government.
And for almost five years we are in practice every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, after all professional and personal characteristics, he is prepared for this work," Ivanov said.
The picture comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather Carls took high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years until 1988 was its first secretary.
The "Media Dauza" with a reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence" that, at the end of the 80s, Karls Vaino asked Moscow to allow Moscow to use force against the demonstrators.
He was refused, however, and lost his post in the near future.
Shortly afterwards, the Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has graduated from the International Institutes for International Relations and is administered by the Japanese.
However, he has gone from the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
As reported, a number of high-ranking officials and even arrests have been routed by several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives.
President Vladimir Putin replicate the ruling elite before the next elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that the representatives of the power structures are becoming more and more frequent.
Nor is the Janikiforenko is losing the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the fight in the first round and the Latvian clusters of the Olympic Games have been completed, finishing 17th place.
Treneris Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that there was very little hope in Nicycle in Latvia's Television, and this has already been clear before the competition.
He also found that the crowd in the struggle has won the crowd in his fight.
It is notable that, in order to go to the Olympic Road Map, the Nicyforenko has had to take place in another weight category than the one - the weight category to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani Guard was more than 25 kilos.
As reported, Jevgeny Borodavko in the championship in the championship in the championship in the championship.
Latvia has therefore closed the gudgon of the Rio Party.
Saples disappear in Rio smile.
A judium Jevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he was in favour of a more elementary opponent, but it can sometimes be seen as a surprise.
He did not miss him.
The challenge of bully Nikiforeni was even more complicated, since experience is less and enemy.
The outcome is similar, though he stays a minute and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvia's gentlemen is missing the most in recent times.
Gunars Kirsons and his financial contribution to Vladimir Seikov, the Golden Score, the Golden Score, "the Golden Score," the Golden Score, "the Golden Score," the Golden Score, "the Golden Score," the Golden Score.
The sparkeys who are advising Kazakhstan's jutorus, and Vpatvoldam Zolons do not see their heirs.
But if we do not grow, there will not be.
And it is the prerogative of the federation.
This is why, as the other galaxis' Rita Panorama, the pledge by the President of the Latvian Dako Federation.
Flight from reality.
In the evening, with impatience and concern we have been waiting for the beaches of Samoilovs / Smedins Evandra / Pee Solbergs.
It is impossible to close the game as the 'death' group: the losers are closing the game.
The Latvian dueth was a small derogation - could also be lost, but no more than four points in two semen.
The tense was still upheld by a long last game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling over the coin over the whole of the match.
The wind of the game caused additional difficulties.
At the beginning it seemed that this could be ours - which is more comprehensive - its ally.
But it did not.
The Latvian duew was quite simply enough.
It is so on Samoilovs and expectations when he will plunge.
Canada has plunged against Cuba at the end of the first six and in the third beginning, because the load was not on the joke.
Smeddling was at the time, because there were little work, but when it was done it was honoured.
Smooth Samoilovs, with a Smedyard could win over two six sessions, as the first took over the lead with 16: 15, but 16 remained, too, a limit of the missing points.
But it was also possible to lose 0: 2, because the second six deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind.
The third is in the vanguard of Evanish.
The verdict is inconclusively accepted, the second sub often lido far too close to the network and the Samoilovs remained at a very low variant in a fruitful attack.
If there was an alien Samoilovs in the field, then this time he worked better, and only on Sau would be unprofessional.
The Kreilin was also mistaken, and it was symbolic that the last bumbs were shot down.
Look at the team.
This time has certainly been lacking in success: two attacks on Evanders almost fly out of the corta, but the ball was still in the line.
Two of the eisi was close to the line.
Conditional episodes have also been the subject of a series of amendments to the Commission's proposal.
If, in the first two games, Evanish with the Serbs, they were very productive.
All together we lost the loss on the tablo.
The causes of the failure must now be calmly analysed.
It may have been a lot to live next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
We went on two and a half hours.
Maybe a little self-confidence in the seven-semi-finals.
Maybe in Clagenfurtis did not have to play, but to come here more quickly here and more emphatic.
Maybe there was a failure to find the top of the arena in the form of sport.
For the time being, the question is more than answers.
We have finished the game.
Ankara over the medals.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup tournament and also the Masters of the Jurmala Masters.
The Samoilovs has never been friends in the life of Samoilovs, because there are too different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, there may also be an idea of divorce, because the blame will be sought not only on the par, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to distinguish, but it is much more difficult for Latvia to find a dignified partner.
Both brothers play a blank game, while Janis with Tomu has already tried and also self-restrained, and Mikhailovs is still too green to start catching the world's top.
There can be an attempt in Haraldu Regans, Alexander Solotin, Edgar Toys, to return to Miss Miss, but it will not be better than this option, which alone showed themselves at the time of World Cup.
The glass sandy was mailed for them this time.
And everything.
Of course, it must also be taken into account that the beaches are becoming more popular, new couples, and only the real growth is less than two metres.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Nowadays are not left.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to settle in the venues offered by games organisers.
The US Basketball Championship live on cruise ship, part of tennis do not stay in the Olympic village.
Similarly, part of the beach voleyte has been searched in the hotel in Columbaban.
This time, the very modest hosts for journalists were asked for a very exaggerated price.
The choice therefore fell to the hiring of apparts.
The risk is because sometimes they may be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Along with the rental apparatus of Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir on the boundaries of the Colonava and Ipanemas.
Puntain 200 metres away, the athlete athlete half a hour.
Rajons are safe because the fascist patent, but the vigilance must not be lost here too.
Vladimir Putin is not what it will be imaginatively imagined, but a professional sport journalist in Russian media, Vladimir Ivanov.
Mr S. looks like a further dream dream on Friday morning.
100 metres of barriers and higheconating Laura Ikauniece-Admidward lag behind his personal record.
But there are already five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, Porgijs and Besa in Liepaja.
In Latvia, Opera Porgijs and Besa's first study was in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised sentiment has not been brought up again.
That is why Creats of the Art Festival and the Spanish Art Arts Forum, have decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to have their audience in close cooperation.
"It is a great pleasure for us that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy an operative study, this great George Guiešvina, Porgijs and Besa" opera concert, "said Baiba Bože, a concert hall," Baiba Bože, a concert hall, "Baiba Bože, head of the concert hall," Baiba Bože.
Porgijs and Besa "is a story of love, its volatility, passions, as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily joys.
It reflects the Afro-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so life.
"And yes, this mystery is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and indeed deep," said Viesturs Kairius.
What I like most, listening to or reconciling this operation, there are always such stop-points - the famous melody, famous motives, but these transitions from one person or another, or corrupt or orchestra.
"This is the most exciting thing, this building," the opera "Porgijs and Besa" concert manager and a conductor Andris Poga.
Operators are in agreement that this is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear the world's famous Guschvina opera.
It is felt that Liepaja can feel the world's eline.
"Professional enforcement," the opera shall be evaluated by Edgars Lams.
The concertation was particularly the case with the fact that the "big engine" for the first time an orchestra, and for the first time an operational concert behaviour.
Farming on the Art Museum, the renovated buildings could be named in the name of JapaRozentla.
Andris Ameriks Rozenthla remark said that a museum of Valmara Street said that a museum of Valmara Street could not be the case of Valmara Street in the future.
Meseja Mir Los said that the reregistration of the address will lead to a considerable bureaucratic burden, but, as a whole, this idea is welcomed and has therefore agreed to the municipality's proposal.
The Riga city has put this idea in 19306, with the Monument of Burkarda Dzeň, which is standing at a museum.
The then Museum, Vilhelm Purvirtis was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be a purely logical one.
I am a little crushed all the time - but Wilhelm Purman, where we will put his name?!
"But if you, Mr America, are going to try to think..."
It is estimated that the National Art Museum building on an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation, was formally opened this year in May.
This week will finally launch the renovation of the VEF Cultural Castle.
A total of around €11 million will be upgraded to Walve.
It is planned to renovate a number of spaces, including two viewers, and adapting the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract €6 million of EU funds to the project, but Oleg Burov, Director of the Riga City Council, said that for the time being, it is not yet clear for European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to launch the VEF Cultural pilij repairs, linking European structural funds is, we await a decision, a real response from the officials of the Treasury will have its money allocated or not," said Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to take the decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
We are now seeing yet another discussion circle again, let us see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council has no doubt guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed within the deadlines," said Burov.
As reported, more than a year ago, in March 2015, the Grand Mufle of the VEF Cultural Palace in March 2015.
Although the year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not commenced and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
The Riga City Council's Registry's Special Entity Strategy, the VEF's cultural Palace is divided into seemingly independent rebuilding works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different parliamentary functions.
The first is increasing the availability of the VEF Cultural Castle and the maintenance of the surrounding area.
It aims to put in place the surpluses and engineering communications, as well as the rebuilding of the building.
Second: improving the supply of services in the VEF Cultural Castle.
It plans to upgrade the site's interior, walls and caps restoration, theatre and sound recordings, as well as to put buildings into internal engineering.
Third - improving the collective working conditions of Creative Reateurs, which includes plans to improve workshops equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the legend of the 40 anniversary, the legendary rock may be displayed in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover various "Ljublus" descriptive objects, photographs of the time frame to reflect the group's activity from pre-eminence by 2010, when the group has been notified of the end of the group.
It will also show participants' spectacles, musical instruments, awards and concerts, as well as other things that have not yet seen in the wider public, which reflected the creative activity of the group's Ljubljana.
The exhibition will be added to the objects of Liepaja museum.
The visual presentation of the exhibition, in cooperation with fashion artist and painting Elita Patmala.
Also, the musicians associated with Lve and their loved ones, referred to the call and shared both objects and memories.
"The beginning dates back to 1972, when Liepaja City is set up in a letter to the Italian city of Liepaja, headed by Juris Pavtol.
Ansamblis took part in its initial form of Liepajas Province in 1972 and 1974, as well as cities and republics.
In 1977 he was a fatal meeting when Juris Pavirtol was set up in the Culture Palace and Metalurg in the Culture Ministry, calling for Ingrid Gneither, Andri Krumneun and Jani Grodums.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been held not once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some returned.
Above all, however, the desire to show that Latvian seal music is able to live and survive - remained stable.
"What has been lacking - the gentlemen, hair and bardini, these boys varied from the general half-way," according to the group, the music inspectorate told reporters in the group.
Excellent musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Kriehe, Mr Modris Schterns, Mr Modris Schterns, Valdis Štark, Laimis Ratnieks, Ainars Plga, Aivars Bill, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
The entrance at the exhibition shall be free of charge.
The exhibition runs from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27, Liepajas concert hall on August 27, Lieni will take place in Liepaja on 27 August.

Because the strength of the truth is greater than the whim of evil.
Many are already on the road to the Safe New Skills in Aglona.
What message will the people like this this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has expressed Pope nuncium in recent years.
Consequently, the content of the key message is in his terms.
It is also a kind of tradition that Bishop is led by Bishop Janis Bulis.
He will also form his own message.
I am on the Finnish public service on the previous day.
Last year, I focused on the Pope Francis of Ucyclicsa, and an update of the global house, the Earth's theme in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I watched what is happening in the world and I have tried to respond to it.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Evangelicum must be put at the centre of life.
It has to be demonstrated that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration to the knee.
It then speaks people.
But in the Churry, the Lamp's discussion, you said that "we need to get back to an understanding of a full man."
What do you understand by that?
Does that mean that man is watching a church's message?
And does the Church, today, is the resource of such return?

At the same time, he points out that if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that he was not considering another candidate, it is a household in Peleus, that it should not be part of the competition.
As reported, Kolegova, head of the State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the Revenue Service's Director General.
As a result of Unity's reservations, the government postponed the approval of Kolegova as Director General of the Revenue Service on Tuesday.
After a decision by the government to postpone its decision, Kolegova confirmed that he is still prepared to become the Revenue Service's head.
At a later date, however, it was changed that, on Friday, the Minister for Finance, Dai Reizniece-Ozleu indicates that she withdraws his consent to the position of the Revenue Service and this is not an easy choice.

It reveals a reconstructed road section.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvia's National Roads (LVC), as well as the representatives of the local authorities of the country's main motorway (Grebnoeva) - Resekne-Daugavpil-Lithuanian border (honey) (A13) from the Smits to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05 km).
The roads are a country's visit map, particularly the border roads, so particular satisfaction is to open up a reconstruction phase at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is yet another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the main roads in the country is improving.
"According to the forecasts, the funds available for the roads will be recovered already in 2018, and we need to think about continuing to maintain the most heavily overloaded motorways, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without the European Union's funding," said Uldis Augulis emphasized.
The Transport Minister also pointed out that the proposals made by road experts on sustainable funding for Latvia's roads will be presented in government.
During the construction phase from the hunt to the Lithuanian border (156,4 to 163,05 km) was launched last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of the reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"Reconstructed road design is fully renovated and renovated next year from the hunt up to the Daugavpilij to Daugavpilij, thereby putting the whole road from the Lithuanian border up to Daugavpilij," said Janis Lange.
The country's main roads are the most busy and, by 2018, we intend to ensure that all major roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to sustain them in good quality by providing timely periodic maintenance and the replacement of the asphalt to 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require appropriate funding, and all the people with hope are looking at the proposals put forward by the expert group to fix the road financing system," noted Mr Lange.
The project sets out road connections and lighting in the centre of honey.
Substantial land works: in four phases, massive discoveries and the magnitude of induce and inscription, an all-time longitudinal approach, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport posts are also updated and rebuilt into public transport.
In the past, the road was insufficient and the localities were not transparent because of the mountainous valley, as well as the old path of common topography.
The next building season is planned to resume the road section from the city of Daugavpils until now for the reconstruction phase (144,80-156.40 km).
This year, the LVC intends to carry out various types of work more than 1 100 kilometres of national roads.
Information on all the renovations planned for the national road network is available on the LVC website at www.enceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired effect of weight reduction, the correct choice of food mix is essential, says the Lithuanian dietology in Laura Romeraite-Kukan lieriene.
In addition, it is easy for the summer period, when our own gardens grow fresh fruit, oveys and vegetables.
The combination of smart food products can help not only reduce overweight, but also to target the various organism processes.
Macaroni and vinegar is a successful combination, as it provides a permanent feeling of happiness and help to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition Experts have shown that the label has a positive effect on glucose blood and help us feel cheats.
Cajena pipari and protein wealthy meals, such as poultry or protein cocktail, not only a sense of grace, but also reduces the scope for large meals on the next meals.
A combination of such meals is also capable of increasing the amount of meals incinerated by meals.
Studies show that Kajena pipari can help to get rid of the flash of fat.
It is a meta-stimulant nutrient, choline, while the case is a good source of C vitamins.
This nutrient may reduce the level of the cornic level, and hence the accumulation of fat in the middle of the body.
The boat dream, accompanied by fresh ovels, is another long and fitted meal of breakfast meshes that are worthy of inclusion in its menu.
Looks and oses contain fibre, which, according to Canadian scientific findings, are controlled by greenhousted hormones - and hence the sense of hunger.
In addition, the ogas contains polyphenols, which are committed to the reduction of weight, as well as in the form of fats.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to do miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of creating a sense of happiness.
Vegetables contain water and fibre, therefore encourages a sense of welcome.
At the same time, the protesting process is slowing down the digestive process and ensures a sense of happiness for a longer period.
Over lunch, poultry can be eaten or prepared for cocktail cocktails out of a finished mixture and enjoy it together with their favourite vegetables.
No product combinations.
In fruit there are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch of vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruit is mechanical, while chemically disaggregated by chemically disaggregated until the third or fourth stage in the digestive process.
The close division into three different stages starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the sweet meal immediately after meals.
Put the sweet in the hall after meal, it is "stuck" with other meals where it is not chemically digested and start to pull.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, bananas or other carbohydrated products together with lemon, happy, oranges, ananasses or other acids.
Enmama ptialine, which is in the sins, works only in the alkali environment.
Fruit acids hinder not only the dialling of carbohydrates, but also contributes to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk, milk and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein products at one meal.
They require different digestive juices, each of them with different characteristics, features and time when it comes to the stomach.
Arczs, meduslie and other melons must always be eaten separately from other meals.
The Black Sea is not digested when they are based on the other foodstuffs.
Farmers in combination with proteins for rich products.
Farmers are making a successful combination with hard, but the same cannot be said of the fat and proteins - the fat are hindering the dialling of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of products containing protein is consumed, let us avoid fat use.
This also applies to freshness - it is not advisable to combine a large number of nuts (containing proteins) with an entire source of fat.
Such a combination hinders the effective weight reduction.
How can you work better?
"Cooking, thermic treatment generates significant nutrient losses: an estimated 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of products," says the rapporteur.
In most cases, nutrients are lost in water, in the majority of cases.
However, the nutritional value of some foodstuffs is increasing, precisely to the detriment.
After the lip of the coated liquid, it is advisable to use soon cooking: in this case, there will be no loss of nutrients remaining in water, and you will be eating them later.
It is advisable to prepare the vegetables, too, to evaporate.
Termismental treatment greatly increases the availability of tomatoes in tomatoes.
For the tomatoes of 30 minutes, the amount of waste will increase by 25%.
Termismental treatment also contributes significantly to the availability of the betacaptine bioavailability found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, the Czech Republic, fresh potatoes and spiral.
The processing of opaque and meat thermic treatment takes away from the natural characteristics of the proteins in these products, making them more easily diitable.
Likewise, the processing of meat and egg thermic treatment makes it easier for the engineers of those products to be absorbed into an organism.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, and the freezing of fibre is not affected.
The combination of the particulates may increase the intake of iron into an organism, which in turn ensures better functioning of the brain and muscle activity.
Our organism takes up to 33% of less anti-blood iron, which is found in plant products such as dirt, page green, grain products than a blood-producing iron in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the penetration of non-blood iron into an organism using non-cardioxonous iron, together with C vitamins, such as oranges, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C contributes to changing the neo-blood iron so that our organism is more easily absorbed by our organism.
Iron is necessary for the production of chemoglobal production, which ensures the supply of oxygen to muscle and brains.
In order to reap the maximum benefit from salts, include the healthy fats such as olives or linseed oil.
In the preparation of butter bread by reading, add a vitamin D to the wealthy lax or sardines, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of the mountainous mountainous calcium and plays an important role in the process of drawing up the bone.
Oats (as well as other co-grain products), together with vitamin sources such as strawberries, rivers, avenues and other fruit or coal, helps to stabilise cholesterol levels, and to avoid the artery of artery.
Snapchat "Anime" has been criticised for caricature of Somali
Snapchat says that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators say it is racist insensical.
The scourge of Snapchat allows 150 million users to change the reality in a rather absurd way and to play with their own identity.
You can turn themselves into anagoats, a dog or a image that fits the Roja Lihishtenstein paintings.
The lake is luminous, images distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million transforted selfes per day.
Any mistake is rapidly becoming public.
Snapchat slowly has been criticised in the past with the accusations that the apparatus for too black or light sans like the ideals beauty.
This week, new lenses have been published this week, which allows users to build a mess, bottles and shoes, and some critics described it as a racist Roman cartoons - "yellow gate."
The question was also raised as to whether such inconsistencies do not show that the company has greater problems with diversity.
"The Verge" and Motherboard said the slowness had been removed from the app. "The Verge" and Motherboard said the slowness had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the purpose of the lenses is to portray Anime's fathers rather than caring the people of Roman origin.
However, people who have experienced racism have highlighted painful stereotypes.
Others categorically deny the likes of Ankara.
In an e-mail, an American art student, Greisza Sparapani on Twitter has received extensive resonance in the e-mail, "she said.
She added that it is difficult not to see the obvious similarities between gambling cartoons and sluggish effects.
This shows that the cheap effects are not simply yellow face and yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
The American culture is also involved in the endless fight for diversity and inclusion, from business premises to Hollywood and the devices we use in everyday life.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing a variety of race, unlike older people, is more sensitive to these cases.
If Snapchat makes a picture outsourcing users, then "nowadays do not go unnoticed," Keitija Žou, a 25-year-old Keitija Žou said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the company's "Medium" product manager has deleted his app of his Snapchat and advised others to do the same.
She explained in her "Medium" and in the telephone interview she said she would like to see the problem of racial problems as a result of the employment policy of Snapchat, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
He criticised the leadership of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded its article with a reference #delegated teSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so there are some other races in the company, but they do not take a position in order to be able to express their opinion safely and conventionally."
They also agree with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many different race is represented by the company, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative said that the company had a staff specialist who will concentrate on the presence of racial minorities, who are not represented at a large level and contribute to an enterprise.
For its part, Jean-Claude won't restore his own account of Snapchat, adding: "I wonder whether they really need more users like us to understand that this is not the right thing."
The Congress of Congress declares that military officials missed reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the Congress of the Congress says that the US Central Command has manipulated reports by depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it is true.
The analysts of the Central Commander's intelligence department is expressing general dissatisfaction at the Armed Forces Committee, the Rescue Committee and the Republican Defense Subcommittee, pointing out that their leadership controlled reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Commander known as Centcom is the military base in Tampa, in the Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report shows that the intelligence reports, approved by the leaders of high-ranking Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positive than it is true: the facts have been regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses.
Ken Calverts, California, Ken Calverts say: 'Centcom action is unacceptable: our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy-makers get untruthful reports. "
Centcom managerial errors can be found under the highest leadership of the organisation.
This 10-page report spells out the existing problems in the coverage and analysis of the Central Society's efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide uncomfortable evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have made it possible to distort the reports, but it shows that the leadership of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to display a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report points out that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Management Press Reductions, statements and reports to Congress have shown the situation in a much more positive light than was actually the case.
For example, the representatives of the Centcom publicly announced that the recovery operation of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosua is the second largest city of Iraq, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Malie Pompeo, the representative of the conservative Party, Malie Pompeo said in his report: 'A number of months' investigation clearly demonstrates this. "
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the main officials of the US central administration distorted reports by depicting ISIS threats in Iraq than they were in fact.
The Republican Party established a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information on the Islamic State is being distorted.
The own-initiative report will be followed by new discoveries in this case on Thursday.
The Ministry of Defence Inspectorate shall carry out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The Socialist Party of the Intelligence Agency gave their own report on Thursday, in which they agree to some of the findings of the Republican party working group.
In her report, Mr Schulz, in his report, the Centcom had been too limited by Centcom in the period 2014 to 2015, Centres had been too limited to the intelligence services' evaluations in connection with ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information ', worsened the working ethics of analysts and" spreading factual facts. "
But the Shiff and Democratic Party said that there was no evidence that the White House has put pressure on the Centcom analysts to produce reports, according to "pre-determined or political positions."
The Daily Beast published the provisional results of the congress.
In August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Inspectorate has launched an inquiry following complaints from Centcom analysts.
The lieutenant commander of the Pentagon, Patrick Evans announced that the Pentagon will not comment on the Congress's report until the investigation is ongoing.
He added that experts sometimes interpret complex data, and the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not just about whether the bombing campaign conducted by the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria (statement made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But the accusations of last year call whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports of Central Management on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism of Islamic State's intelligence is reminding over ten years of ancient events where Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs Hutors, claiming that George W. Bush's administration began the Afghan War, thinking too little about its potential consequences.
Hubker played an important role in detecting the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hluker team had revealed that, as opposed to public reports, airstrikes in the Islamic State oil plants have not significantly deteriorated the financial position of a terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell the oil market.
The Times in September reported that this discovery did not come outside of the Central Management walls.
Meanwhile, the Centcom commander General Laurence Ostins III, received sharp criticism as many of the lawmakers thought that the war reports describe the situation too positive.
In April, General Ostins took office and his seat was taken by General Djozefs Mr Votels.
In the United States, Britain won the United States with Britain, thus making the fourth win in a row.

Five gates in two games is an incredible achievement, but the 27-year-old Bama said that she would not be able to remember, or that it would ever have been successful.
She said: "I have no idea."
I am not one of those people who have taken the gates.
But she knows that the Olympic Games in the Olympic Games are 4: 0, which gives them the chance to extradite Britain in their group, which won a 2-0 victory over Japan on Thursday 2: 0.

The first prize winner will be a little longer from meeting with the strong Dutch choice, which is the leader of the second group.
Though the Saturday's game, the Americans have already voiced surprise storms four years ago in London, four years ago in London.
There was also a Bama team in the team.
She grew up in the Butbelt, the field hockey to her first time in the age of 3 (her nurse's nurse's nurse had already worked with this sport in Drear) and the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a random in the history of the youngest players.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not enter the finite.
But 2012 was unfortunate for her and her team.
In the coming year, an English Kregs Parchama was appointed and everything changed for the better.
That was referred to as' cultural, mentality and physical change '.
In London we did not invest as much work as we now.
We have changed everything.
Bama scored the result in the first half of the first half of the week, with the snow in the first half of the week.
India's game began without victory in its account, but their selection was very fierce and kept a minimal result of 0: 1 to the third period, when the goals were re-established.
She introduced a bomb for the leftist side of the square, then we looked at the middle of the square and to send a bomb in the gateway to the Americas 2: 0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalesa got another goal.
This was the first United States' gatekeepers' Bruges, the first three games of the first three games.
She has come to grips with her.
And as well as Bama.
"We are going very well at the moment," he said.
The depressing mess of the depression period is the 'Ethical meal'
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Frenklyn Delano Rugzveted in the ovai room in order to sustain a meal.
President Rugzvely tasked with fine culinary defeates such as the liver stretches of geese, such as goose and Meriland turtles.
However, on that occasion, his meal was much more modest: performed eggs in tomatoes, potato beans and daughter flowers.
Jade Ziegelmane says: "This is a way to show solidarity with the people who have been very hard."
Her husband, Andris Kou said: "This is also a message to the Americans, how we should eat."
A couple of the Brooklyn Heights is meals for historians.
In the last book, "Garzeal Daine" describes Chinese kitchen in America, but Ziegelmane describes in his book "97 Abeles" in his book "97 Abeles.
Their new joint work on the 'Ethical Timeline, "published on Tuesday by publishing Harper on Tuesday, is a story of the American building in the Great Depression.
By showing a degree of solidarity in the area of culinary, they were portrayed by the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch in the district of Flathrone and operating from 1929, when the great depression began.
Ms Ziegelmans, Ms Ziegelmanes ordered butter with fused cheese and olives, while the 57 years old Kou ordered the sweet, potatoes, potatoes and vegetable sallies.
When a reporter commissioned fake green, a couple said that his choice is a very relevant discussion about the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmans said that the fake lake was very popular.
consisted of the globe, the liver chambers, green and puppies a green light.
They were prepared from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that have enriched the meals.
It is, as it is, to eat so many gloves so that they are instead of lunch.
Mr Kou got off.
"It seemed to be perfect with lead," he said.
In the years of the predepression, the American lunch was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women prepared to eat their male and female workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the first World War, it was the Americans who sent the eat to Europeans, "the Sami meal described how Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly ceased to land of plenty.
"At the time, the thread became the American people's main focus on the day," said Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on the subject.
It was just as important to have a new budget: such unknown food as a fake lake and sadness turned into everyday life, interconnectors were 'an excellent way to use surpluses, "said Ziegelmanes, because the boil could mask unattractive ingredients under the taste.
The fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat which has been the main part of the American meals for years, now became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calorie and food nutrition were more important than long, new unseen arrangements were born.
In a long book, Mrs Ziegelmane, has found a recipe for paving the scene with a peanuts.
Mr Kou said: "This was not a popular lunch advent table."
Mrs Ziegelmans emphasized: 'It was the heart'.
The loat butter and the skin are not compatible.
Many domestic appliances applied to difficult times.
household economists such as the Louis Stenley, the Federal Office for Household Others from 1923 to 1943, established national eating habits not experienced before the Great Depression or afterwards.
When publishing articles and magazines, they recommended that they be "economises" and to meet the challenges of converting the mackerel and carrot mystics.
"Secret Maltinte" means an historical guarantee soldier.
It is particularly interesting to testify to the attitude of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Hubb, let me eat a cake 'attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and catering in Aioja, in fact he was eating a fine millionaire that he had become.
Mr Kou tells us: 'They got a European kitchen, for example, the sausage of cucumbers. "
He eaten up almost the gold in the guns, wearing a half-day jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Rūfish would have made the same mistake, unless his wife Eleonora had not advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells that Rugis a domestic worker who did not teach ready to eat, so that the White House became a place "where one of the most inspiring eals in Washington, but also the worst of the meals made in Washington, but also the worst of the meals made."
As soon as the country's economy recovers, the vast majority of the depression of the culinary of the depression.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as the use of science in culinary, added Ziegelmans.
It is said that when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of the motherhood of Mrs Ziegelmanes, for example why she was unable to throw the baby out.
"She was really afraid to throw the eat," said Mr Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmans said 'she actually steered people'.
There was once again an incident with wind turbines.
When we had eaten in the eat of Eisenberga, the writer was a desert from the Finnish home: a flowing bottle of the bags.
"This is a flowing bottle," said Mrs Ziegelmans, adding that at that time there was a common habit of modest meals to give the name.
It is not a pupil, just dried leavers, slightly meals, sugar, water and canal.
Everyone was impatient on the flags of the flags that were on the side of the flags.
Surprisingly, it was not so bad.
Mr Kou ezed a few more coincidental.
After an experienced 'economist', he said a wife, "he said a wife," he said.
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck on Hepatitis C
A member judge has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc." has the right to refund the expenses for lawyers paid in the case of the Hepatitis C patent against the Society Merck & Co Inc. "
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of the breaking up of two Merck patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Soruled SoGovernment and Harvoni tablets when the US federal judge found a breach of Merk's operations, such as hunting after oath and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, the US district judge Bet Labsons Frmens said that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenditure that has arisen in this case.
Merck is trying to get a position on the market against Gilead, who is dominated on the market with a new-generation Hepatitis C, which is effective for 90% of liver diseases.
The case was launched as early as 2013, when Gilead and Merck polled each other by trying to obtain ownership of the newly developed active component sopbuvir, which is the main element of Gilead medicines.

The publication of taxes on taxes is a guide for US presidential candidates, but this does not require a law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason to dispose of tax information.
"You're a march ', Iang Sama, a member of Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sama told reporters.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser Michael Kohens said that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before completing the closest.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans say that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, the amounts of donations and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton filled the oils in the polls, a video on Friday, where a number of influential Republican voters claim to make his tax information publicly available on Friday.
She returned to this question during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan on Thursday.
She said "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for several decades."
"Politico" says that during the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes at all, and the New York Times column said that many accounting officers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an essential issue in this presidential election.
Clinton in favour of the billionaire's Varena Bafeta, promoting the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year, has to pay a tax at least 30%.
This proposal is supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebrass, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Bafets said that he also had an audit of the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of the voters and not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton is now living in Clinton, New York and between 2007 and 2014 have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are alive.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, of which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

The Berlin Hebreviation of Jewish filmmaker criticise the hotel in Berlin on the withdrawal of the Israeli disturbances following an arlast demand - the RT report
The French film director of the Jewish French film filmmaker in social media when it reveals that "Kempinski Bristol's hotel in Berlin is not available at the Israeli distance code in Berlin.
Klope Lancmans, documentaries of the Holocaust "Shoah" director, did not hide my dissatisfaction with the Berlin hotel, Kempinski Bristol, the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman was trying to find the Israeli telephony hotel list.
However, this country was not included in a list of countries that may be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that, in Berlin in 2016, the new German capital, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
Mr Lancmans.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol, the hotel offers a call to that country through its call centre.
The rhythm asked for an explanation from the staff of the hotel.
Lancmans writes that the answer received 'shocked'.
The managing body of the hotel explained that "it was a conscious decision by the hotel management decision."
The reason for the removal of the Code was further annoyed by the film maker.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they called for the withdrawal of the Israeli code," Lancmann, cites an explanation of the hotel worker.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said that the ambassador of Israel, Jakov Had-Handelsmann, was called "great shame."
We are surprised and shocked about this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany, it is precisely this hotel network is even more humiliated.
There is no need for clarification.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event has been quite a great deal of resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply plummeted out to Arab clients.
Another article said that the hotel was in the streets of Kurfurstendamm on the street side of the hospital in the streets of Kurfurstendamm on the street side of the hospital.
Der Spiegel's statement that the hotel was quick to reject all reproaches by stating that all of this was "misunderstanding" and apologised to Lanzmans.
"We have not received a direct debit to withdraw Israel from the national numbering list, Sudan deutsche Zeitung cite Kempinski.
And to add that the code was added again to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against the protesters in Brazil.
The collision between students and police took place on Thursday in São Paulo in Brazil, where students gather in a demonstration against reforms to the government's education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to students.
The problems started when the police attempted to erase the students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in demonstrations to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmina's proposal to close down almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to savings.
Some demonstrators were marked on walls with messages against temporary President Maiklu Temera.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gather in the demonstration in order to support the unplanted president in Dilmu Rousefai, for which the senate was voted in favour.
Scottish Catalonia is finishing the first to bring Britain's gold medals on bicycle
The Skiners of Scotland finished the first male bicycle in the Rio Maire, which took place last night.
The 23-year-old athletes played an important role in this race, making proud of the legendary Scottish Krisu Hogan and his victory for New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won the fifth of his sixth Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated this in the World Championship in London, even though Houses had already graduated his career.
The problems were between the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympic Games, because we had to replace the experienced specialist Jessica Stafu.
They managed at the last minute.
When the Houses went, she was trying to fill his seat with Kiang Emadi and Mets Krampton.
The British coaches were hoping for the Skinver, seeing the potential he has subsequently shown.
Hinks, Kenny - the champions, a four-year season with Houses and Skiners, who set a record for the Olympic qualification, but the race was a head of the New Zealand team.
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The hubs were in close poles, Kenya was under the leadership and the Skiners protected this leadership.
The change of the strategy played an important role in the vicinity, because Hindes drive more carry-overs in order to allow Kenya and in particular the Skinver to drive faster.
Houli watched the BBC's spokesman and watched Skinera, Kenyan and Hindesa viewers at the moment when they rose to codial.
The 23-year-old glass said: "It was an awful honour."
I am doing everything to defend my name.
We installed the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better victory.
After the victory, along with Kenya and Houses, the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindes admitted that deliberately fell to the tracks after the unsuccessful start.
Later he was refuted and British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
This time there was no such incident.
Hings said: "Britain's flags in the tribes remembered London."
Over the last three months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the Olympic Games were indeed a special one.
One medals will be met by a country that won seven of the ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team-progress indicator over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of the Holy League with three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six wold-up gold and one silver medals, but also Kenny was born on 23 March (it seems to be the British sacred date, because Steve Wilivs, Mo Farah and Roger Banisters).
Holy was born on that date.
Kenya is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old Athleman said from Botburg said: 'At this moment I am simply enjoying it all.
The package is always the best.
For it can be won together with teammates.
If honestly, one is a little lonely. "
Hindes said: "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed by armers."
It was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlij Vigins, Ed Klensiii, Steve Burks and Ovein Dooul showed the highest qualification period for four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The world record, installed in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the finger will take place today in the second half of today, where the Vigins will certainly be the focus.
Yesterday, before a qualification trip, he had a disagreement with fasariate when he was summoned by a judge to measure his growth.
The Women's Day, which will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Josanna Rovsela Šanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Archibalda from Milan.
The British delegation hopes that the British bicycle, cerot. will win the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and in London, all of us expect the same progress towards Rio.
In the meantime, he said, "he said," he said.
However, the start of the first bicycle races, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland fup becomes unclear because an ambitious agreement is interrupted.
Aluminium smells and hundreds of its staff in Portland, in the Viktoria, as its main customer energy company has announced interruption.
This statement is based on the plans of the Victoria Government to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital to enable the company to continue to work.
20 years of subsidies will be cut off in November.
As a result, over 2000 Alcoas Portland factories are at risk.
It could be up to 2000 both direct and indirect jobs.
In addition, it will also have unforeseeable effects, as the battle consumes around 10 per cent of the electromagnetic supply chain.
In 2014, Alcoa took note of the disruption in Alcoa in 2014, which led to a disruption in operation of the Angleseas plant.
Alcoa Portland battle is working with losses and can be closed.
These events triggered a number of years of speculation on the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The industrialised energy supplier "AGL" that delivers energy from its "Loy Yang A" power plant in Iroubes, says that the other three owners will probably cease their contracts.
Most of the power stations are the "Alcoa" and Alumia, in addition to the company's share in CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL" looks forward to the continued operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply in a battle, "said its representative.
"AGL" said the contracts are so-called "trade-restrictive contracts" to enter into force as of November 2016.
The Treaties have a period of validity of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts in 2017," said the company's representative.
Starting from the possible impact of the 2018 fiscal year on favourable market forecasts for the wholesale prices of electricity in the future.
"AGL" claims that its forecast has already taken account of losses of $187 million, providing that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contract will not affect the ability of the 'Alcoa' to continue to pursue its fusion activities or to supply energy.
The US company says that in 2010 it entered into a contract with Loy Yang to 20 years, but it will be cut off in November.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the possible closure of the Portland fugeing and the closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle near Newcastle, due to the weak economic economy in the sector.
"AGL CEO Sthabens Mikelsons said last week that 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megavatus in Portland.
If the two factories were to leave the energy market, then the demand for energy would significantly decrease.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
More than 160 000 people have been rejected every year, with a decrease in the budget, the situation might deteriorate.
Three out of five people in Khartoum - mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal evictions, free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that the situation will become worse.
From June next onwards, these legal centres will receive 30% less than up to now.
The director of the Kwlenda Legal Centre, James Farel, said that the latest Association of National Law Central Center said that there is now a refusal of legal aid to thousands of people in need.
Mistrs Farel said that if this decision is not lifted, then the situation will only be worse.
He also says: "The legal centre of the wine is chronically underfunded, which means that aid is being given to the thousands of people in need."
People who are trying to end the violent relationship, people with deep debt, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce the funding by 30 percent, which means that many thousands of people in the Karolland will have to face up to their complicated legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and the Senator of the Kinesland Senator George Brandisa immediately to halt the cuts in funding so that people who need legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government launched its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the country's average level.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of local communities and their customers, and the government of Palazcka to invest in this important area.

A new tradition: pasture and sports festivities in Culolia.
On Saturday, in the Culoh, people gathered for the first time in the Cabinet of Cultures.
After a decade of celebration, it was decided that the Ezer's festive will no longer be.
A new chapter has been broken.
The day began with sporting competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, the shot was shot away from the beautiful flight, with a manleft hand, the 'bumbling' has not been in any Olympic Games at all.
However, each member was able to show how strong, courageous, luck and attacking him.
After sport, everyone gathered an open-air activity, where sacred festivals began.
In the meantime, the 'children's corner', where small could have been lost at the edge and acquire a new image in the sejm.
The new, which could also become a tradition, was a driving phenomenon where both tractors and motorcycles went into.
All of this was addressed by Inga Kadiķe-Skadina, who had wished a nice rest and dry time, rarely, but it was unable to do so much.
In St, we continued with the audience of the youngest inhabitants.
It is really good that the memories have been enriched with five girls and one boy.
The guns of the cartoons were brought to the ranks from Engures in the wake of the kidnappers, "Rudens wheels," the "Least Developments" of the different peoples "Reda" and the Golden Beans of Young People's Palme.
And this is nothing that the spectator was also swept into the scene.
Of course, local people and their villages were joy of the famous ackesman, Jānis Jarans and Dainis Porgants, who were once again at the Mildiya Poorus and Clear Kanana, as well as the children of children.
"Bruciis."
Britain must hold the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my view, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work to all the regions of the country to benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Le Pen won an awful lot of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be people who think that this challenge is too high and that Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain will never be prepared to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a worldwide failure.
The sceptics were wrong for 2012 and also in the case of Heathrow, they will not be true.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits the whole of society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth amounting to 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and the whole of Britain.
Heaven has a great team in Heathrow, which has created 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme, starting with a terminal within 5, which has been called the best airport terminal in the world to the terminal 2, which has been built between two more intensive road roads in the world to a terminal 2, which has been built between the two more intensively used paths in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third runway, financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London Olympics in London were a great success, and I am sure that Heathrow enlargement will also be this.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord David Deitons is a member of the board of Heathrow and former Business Secretary of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman strikes a great deal, trying to commit suicide.
The night was on the grand night.
The police are trying to find witnesses in an accident at the early hours of the morning on Thursday.
The accident took place shortly after midnight on the A1 road near Vo cantons.
The police of Vo cantons said that desperately wanting to commit suicide, the woman had gone on the road, where he was crossed by a number of cars.
Clearly, trying to kill yourself, the victims, the 49-year-old Swiss muster, came a number of cars, including heavy machinery.
She died in the place of the event.
A number of the drivers involved have already given evidence, while others have not yet been clarified, the police calling for the drivers involved and the witnesses of the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched, which is a logical step in this case, for the benefit of Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet clear whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofsteller said: "This is what the prosecutor said."
Two similar incidents that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrians had gone down on their knees, so it was decided that drivers could not predict a pedestrians, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a policeman was acquitted to kill after his negligence in August 2014, a man who was sleeping in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Payernes.
The Court of Justice found that the 22-year-old victim was drink and later sighted to sleep on the road.
The court concluded that a policeman, on its way to an accident, was in an appropriate manner and judge admitted that the beautiful man on the road was "completely unforeseeable and exceptional."
Anyone who has information about an accident on Thursday is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.

The petition was created on August 10, with 55 people subscribing.
The nomination process of Inga Kolegova, the head of the Revenue Service's Director General of the Revenue Service.
This is reminiscent of the best practice of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again makes society disillusionment in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the petition said.
Its author Janis pointed out that the Society does not have criteria for the selection of Kolegova.
Nor is it clear what the candidate's candidates will have in their offices.
According to the Petitions Committee, the State Chancellery should build a new open competition with professional candidates, attracted specialist selection professionals and offer appropriate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola was formally appointed to head office of Kolegova Revenue Service's head of the Revenue Service's head of the Revenue Service, but all the Unity ministers voted against, so the matter was postponed a week.

The ratio of three couples was recorded in the ratio of three couples, which, after this match, was the most disadvantaged in Latvia's dueth.
"In the first half, it was under the leadership, but from 16: 15 it was 16 points," the game was remembered by Smedins.
I do not even know how the remaining part of the sixth half remained uncertain.
It must not.
In the second six, everything was in order and the game was able to break the game, and it should have been a good foundation for the third six.
We started this in a similar way, but when the parties changed, the result was only one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the Sub-Group, all teams were similar, in almost all the match, so there were small points.
"We ought to play a more equal footing, rather than remitting 3-4 points in a row," the athlete said.
We know that Evane can be burned.
"In the first half of this season, 1-2 points, while the third to + 4 had already played a game," said Smedins.
We tried to show the best game.
They came to the scene.
The picture of the joint assessment was not seen before the bread, but it was known that as many small points were needed.
"If we lost," he said.
The Evanders were waiting for good Serve and the first six of this season, but the third has been open and it was difficult to make an attack.
On the other hand, I am making a lot more wrong with the bag, but it had to be managed.
Samoilovs said that, contrary to the previous match, athletes were not nervous.
"We were, he said, was also defensive, but there was a better excuse," he said.
"They were pretty well played and the end came to the 'haurier'.
Before he said at the outset that the email was the most uncomfortable that could have been.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even out of the group.
"All of us were expecting the medals and we also had a difference, but then there is no difference - 25th or fourth," said Samoilovs, who predicted that they would continue to play in the future as well.
I think there will be no question and will continue to play together, because this is just one Turkish.
The Samoilovs in Rio was already the third-Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in Beijing in 2008.
In the meantime, this was the second launch of the Olympic Games.

Dmitry Saidjaviv, whose neighbour started to repair the capital of his apartment and, since then, Dmitry is discarded and there is no certainty for staying in the country.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out an arbitrary construction and, in my apartment, have been damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Board, the house manager and other organisations.
The board said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any expertise.
"The animal owner must go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry said.
The expert invited arrived, ficted events and recognised that the bonus was in a disappointing situation.
However, a month has passed since the first Dmitry's application, and until the beginning of this week, it was also unable to answer whether there is a danger of living in life.
It is the legislature that this is the legislation, wait for, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council but they transferred to the house manager, then the house manager once again to the building board, and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
After all the details of the paper, it is clear that construction works have been halted, somebody is going to work there.
An expert and an apartment owner carrying out the repairs have to be carried out within a period of two months, all these defects should be remedied.
The independent expert has drawn up its opinion, but it is considered by the Board of construction to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal metal troubles present in this ineffectual structure, so there is no certainty that the owner of the subapartment is to pose a threat.
"That's why we have asked for an additional explanation from this expert," Ilze Jacoka, representative of the Riga City Council.
In spite of the ban on carrying out any repairs in the Upper apartment, the construction will continue.
The punishment for arbitrary construction without construction is between EUR 70 and 700, but in this case the penalty may be much more severe.
As long as an expert opinion is expected, the Board of Governors decided that the two flags may not be exploited, both of which are under construction and the Dmitry's apartment.
"This is not the case in the works of the construction board, where, in this way, its ignorance, or simply by unwillingness, the citizens have probably caused a threat not only to its own property but also of the sub-property owner, as a result of which the owner may not operate his property," the board of the board of the story.
It is up to Dmitry to look for another place in which to live - with relatives, friends, hotel or other homes.
But the losses that have occurred, Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbouring civil justice round, which can take a lot of time.
As a result of the arbitrary construction, both of which are currently banned, until the engineer will have its conclusion, and it may have to wait for three weeks.
The losses will have to be borne by the holder of the apartment in which the repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment is due to the fact that the construction board has not taken into account, also threatens the prison sentence for up to six months.

NASA Climate Model: Venera once had a residential planet
On the basis of the latest climate models in NASA, Venera has once had an inhabitable planet.
Scientists from the NASA Godard Institute for the Space Research Institute to explore the Venera's history through tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venera, the surface of which is hot, where there is no water and where the atmosphere is almost exclusively of carbon, in which the Earth has had similar conditions for the Earth.
Scientists have already mentioned in advance that the Venezuelan slow pace is due to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation shows that the Venus has once had a plan, a climate similar to the Earth and has turned a slow.
The model also looks at the earlier topography of Venera.
The planet has been more dry area than on Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity in order to be able to develop life and prevent the evaporation of water.
In the early times of Venice, the Sun was 30 percent more brighter.
The GISS model simulation of the GISS model reveals that the daylight part of the daylight on 2 months, according to a press release, Mr Antonijs Del Genio explained the GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio.
This process is a warm surface of the planet and leads to a case which, in turn, consists of thick clouds working as a umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of Saine.
As a result, temperate temperatures are developing, which is, in fact, a few degrees below the earth's temperature.
The model illustrates the Venezuelan history, similar to the evolution theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Even though it was inhabitable, over several billion years, Venaroa has been subject to too much heat and ultraviolet rays.
The oceans went on the oceans and the garages burned the ultraviolet rays.
For the water, the water has gone beyond the carbon dioxide climate of a lethal greenhouse gas - Venera, as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new "Geophysical Research Letters magazine" Geophysical Research Letters. "

The workers of the North Sea Oil platform will resume negotiations and put on strike
Workers' strike on the wages of the workers of the North Sea oil platforms have been postponed due to the resumption of negotiations between the two parties in the dispute.
Periodice against the oil treatment company Wood Group are taking action on the oil platforms in the North Sea oil platforms operating in the Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that the Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions have agreed to relaunch negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled to start at the beginning of next week with the aim of revising the issues of concern.
The trade unions said that their recent events organised after more than 25 years have been taken against a planned salary reduction of 30 percent.
As a result of negative pressure on the market, the Wood Group reduced salaries in the North Sea by 9 per cent this year.
As early as 2014, the company reduced the wages of terrestrial workers by 10 percent.
Compliance explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the downturn.
Shell has already reduced the wages of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimise their work in the run-up to a large-scale merger deal with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is more complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Member of the Scottish Parliament, met with the workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the state as a whole need an economy which benefits everyone, not individual individuals.
In 2016, almost 1.4 billion dollars are earmarked for new North Sea projects, compared to USD 7 billion, invested in the last five years.
The size of the bottoms of the stars must be pumped stars.
The latest directory's mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of the stars of the stars of the winning phase.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars go on different speeds, as well as the manner in which the speed of the strips is attributable to planes.
"We hope that compared to our results with other stars, we will get more information on the connection between the mass, age and even the sunfun system," the news news release said by the World Caltech Autonomy Center and Analite Centre, Luisa Rebula reported on the news release.
Pleto the stars of 445 lights from the Earth.
Many stars are starting to grow in this stars, reaching around 125 million years of age.
They shall be reversed at a maximum speed.
Drawing on a maximum speed, this growing stars divide a large number of stars wind.
They are putting their stars in magnetic fields, they put a brake on the stars.
Ages ageing, the speed of their turmoil is decreasing.
The Cap is measured at the speed of each of the stars, setting the timing between the appearance of recognisable stars, such as solar panels.
The latest speed catalogue of stars shows that more stars are lower than the stars lower than the stars.
The recession compares stars with the stars with the leaf, higher wedges are slower than a small dwellers.
It is telling us that the Pleto's white "balgo" shows that the slowly rotating sites are larger and larger, while the more rapid roid sites are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that Pleto stars are so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory for comparing the characteristics of the stars with the pace of cutting.
It is telling us that Pleach stars helps build theoretical models for the star rotation in both directions, both parents and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why we slow down the speed of the stars and their full stop process.
The bullet and his colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the Broadcasting speed of the three new publications, which will shortly be published in Astronomy Journalism.
