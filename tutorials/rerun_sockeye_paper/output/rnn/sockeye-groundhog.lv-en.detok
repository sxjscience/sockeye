Labelling on Wednesday was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco Galicia, sentenced to a 28 years, said Sanfrancical Court medical expertise office representative.
The San Francisco police stated that his death was recognised as murder and is currently under investigation.
The Grand Much of Upura, Louis Galicia, told the San C KGO that he was working in Boston, but six months ago he had his dreams. "Sons & Daughters" Sanfrancical restaurant.

New outgoing strike: call for new protests
The new foreign representatives call for their trade unions to enter into protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The UK Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to request the Council to support broader protests at the beginning of September.
The JUC considers that ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, the new doctors and medical students rejected the Treaty of LMA.
58% of all members who participated in the vote have voted against the Treaty.
On Thursday evening, on Twitter, the JAN Council member Eslow Makcorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore has rejected the offer.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK vote has resulted in a total rejection of the contract and decided to request new formal negotiations to discuss key issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with LMA to allow authors of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including, for the first time in NHS history, work.
After the vote rejecting the contractual conditions proposed by LMA, the LMA resigned in LMA's new foreign representative Dr Johans Malawana was resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had said BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Dgeremijs Hants informed the House that the contract would be concluded with the medical medics of England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance excluded?
Jacques Barrot, who ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to get rounds and announce the end of the war of eight months and the end of the economic sanctions war.
However, Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish leader in St Petersburg, the impression that this partnership is needed more than Ankara.
However, both rook.
Vladimir Putin looked at the cloudt and did not provoke warm emotions, even in view of his customary reservations.
On the other hand, the Anthyp Erdogan Erdogan called Putin at least five times a "dear friend," the meeting will look at.
I felt the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve before the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
In the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan came up as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm is causing contradictory feelings.
However, Putin's irradiated cancer shows that the Russian leadership has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the introduction of Russian planes on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara that it was inspired by a dunk in Moscow.
The transmission was even more painful given that it came from friends.
It will be very difficult to restore real confidence, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russian public position has changed.
For several months, government controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it was all the Turks who were guilty.
The most serious accusations were that the family of the Erdogan has made profit from the illegal part of the Syrian oil trade with the Islamic State controlled by Islamic State.
He himself denied that, of course.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology for President Erdogan.
Russia could take this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of the Ankara peace agreement are obvious.
Firstly, the Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he tried to overload him.
The numerous terrorist attacks, too, have shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused profound damage, in particular the banning of charterremes, which typically provides for a number of millions of Russians of Russian tourist tourists in Turkey every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tokers and chartercompanies are also facilitated when regular flights will be restored.
They look forward to the patchwork of leave in the Mediterranean.
This week, national TV provides for a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's imports of fruit and vegetables will be restored.
According to the local newspaper Vedemosti: 'Tourism for them, tomato us'.
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West, he believed, weak reactions to the coup d'état.
Everyone can also see frustration with the lengthy negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin intervention, which is happy to use the situation that Turkey has alienated from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara's eye by expressing support for its elected government after a coup d'état.
Please note that Moscow is well aware of this, because the fear of a regime change in the country itself is deeply rooted.
Samits, which took place in this glun by-sea filling, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present an analysts, 'marginalised alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity of publicly demonstrated unity, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement affects Syria, where Russia is presenting itself as a peace media, but in fact Russia and Turkey are in favour of the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wanting to disclose information, the two presidents announced that they had not discussed this matter.
The Turkish President purposedly avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to underline them.
There is no clear consensus how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes in which NATO member Turkey shocked Russia's battleplane, the situation has improved because both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
Scottish Karalal Banka will no longer have access to customers outside Scotland
The Stamp SKB will continue to play a role in supporting the role of the Bank's Executive Director.
The Scottish SKB will no longer be available for the Scottish SKB.
Ross Mackegan told the BBC channel in Scotland that SKB's brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because, eight years ago, the bank almost bankrupt and required financial assistance.
In the meantime, the experts of the brands have used a branding of SKB in order to protect other consumers' financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Siberian League of Nations and finally with the Mureur Championship of Vimbldon.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
Scottish customers will have access to Scottish customers, but it will not be originated.
In England and Wales all the references of the IRB reference, outside the main office and official stock exchanges, will be replaced by NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, a brand The Ulster Bank is already used.
Also, smaller retail financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will also be noteworthy.
Macrors were interviewed during their journey with customers and staff by Inverifshire.
He told the BBC's Scottish channel: "The SKB will become a brand of our investors and who works our workers, because we are now becoming more brand banks."
The Bank itself became a global brand and the IRB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in her sector and our employees will work with their customers under these brands.
The ICC has already announced that there is no continuing sponsorship of the "Six Union" and will involve different brands in sponsoring sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long been asking ourselves the question of becoming a better bank for their customers?
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we were to announce that we will become an excellent bank for our clients and to develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not for our own needs, we obviously have made major changes.
Once again, we can revive these brands, so I think that now is the time.
Ctors win 3000th win, win the first place in Newcakerel with horse Predilection
Detors recork the shots, fighting their 3000th victory twice as finishers at the first race in New Newsroom.
On Friday, the Treasury scored his 3000th victory in Britain's history, with the first place in Newcakerel.
He reached it, fighting the second victory in those clashes that took place in his home city, with the Predilection of John Goswater.
A 45 year-old Italian is a sixth fence that has reached the horse races of the horses.
He has joined the Serb Gordonam Ričardus, Dougam Smitry, Lesteram Pigot, Peter Ederia and Villius Karsons.
The rhetoric champions of the champions, who had previously won the horse Ghayyar, said: "This is something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this was in Newcakerel because I live here for 30 years.
This is not a great race, it is not Karalal AScotta, but an ordinary Friday evening, together with 20 000 people.
I feel relieved and thankful.
Detors and the Predilection are expected to be applauded and gasioned.
Two fences have reached this record with the obstacles: champions, Ričards Johnson and quarrying 20-regular champions of Sir Antonijs Maw, who installed in his career Having said a number of record times, more than 4300 victory.
He won 4493 victory during the career.
The phray is one of today's best fences and is no surprise that he has made progress that only the real can achieve.
He is a glass and strong, but his sense of tactics is separated from other fences.
He is a fantastic representative, his enthusiasm and charism for years attracting fantasy for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsomas races, I said to the Frenchman that he would have fought already 6,000 victory if you did not share the weekend at the weekend and in the big race.
However, it is a real joy that the Frenchy has been in power for 30 years in the United Kingdom for 30 years.
He is a life of life, which is great in British races, and he is an excellent fence.
The tors noted this achievement with a sign of his firm, a flight leap.
From the finishing wind up to a flight, the Treasury Ttors for twenty years has been raining the British horse face for twenty years.
This has been a complete way of life.
He has won countless large ractures, including the famous 1996 'Big Seekeer' Aské, and survived the aircraft accident and the disqualification as the use of preparations.
Three years ago he was difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his own strength, challenging those who questioned him back in their best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - the tors have said earlier that I would be happy to continue to take part in the race at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismiss his administration, Sergei Ivanov, President
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the government leader Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Putin has found Putin closer to the nearest people.
The 63 year-old politician has now been appointed a Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement says Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the head of the Russian presidential administration," without mentioning the reason.
Instead, I appointed Antons Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 44 year-old Vaino has been a diplomat.
Waino is born in 1972 in Tallinn in Tallinn, a prestigious Prestige Institute of State International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in Tokyo.
According to the Kremlin's homepage (Russian), he led the Presidential and government staff administration later.
After appointment he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the country when drawing up laws and controlling your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and was recomposing Vaino as a substitute.
Is smiles persuaded?
This step confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is sens and close to Vladimir Putin's allies and, like Putin, worked at the time of the Soviet Security Service.
He was one of the most influential husbands in Russia.
At the sitting of the public television, both men stated that Ivanov resigned from his own initiative.
But notwithstanding the smiles of the cameras, it is rare that such an explanation is reassured, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the fight for power?
Nobody knows.
However, the official statement that the man who was regarded as a possible president suddenly wanted to become a leader of the Russian environment policy is perceived by a great scepticism.
In the Kremlin's homepage, Ivanov says Putin: 'This is a fact that, at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust this difficult office, perhaps even to say, problematic positions, four years.
I have indicated that I have been working for this post four years and eight months.
Ivanov came into office in December 2011.
He has previously been Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former National Security Service Officer, as Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the GB, who has taken his deputy office.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov for the number of five people who are most committed to him.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was considered as a potential candidate for President of Russia because Putin's re-election to the third term would be anticonstitutional.
However, then, the President became another close to Putina's allies - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to the president after three and half years.
Myclan of fish in a garden city of Banfas
What husband from Banfas is asking for help to clarify the conditions for which species of species appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bein thinks 75 fish could be laughed, who had travelled with water.
Mr Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, made it possible to know about the aggression of the fish video on the Periscope, expected to know how these 5 centimetres in their great fish are in his garden.
The crowd of the wine fermentation: bridge is now connected with Faifu.
At present, €1.35 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineering has been connected to the northern part of the Cwine Cross and viaduktu, which means that the bridge is now connected with Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the construction of bridges is coming to a close.
The structure of the Faiff bridge is 600 metres long and weighed 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support for cables.
Today, 1.35 billion pounds worth projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
The economic secretary Keits Brauns was today on the construction site and was one of the first to go on the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of a bridge in Kwine-fertilla."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution where only the construction of this part has been used by more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight of the bridge and the combination of size, bridges and viadukta is an extremely delicate process in which enormous precision is needed.
Overall, more than 79% of bridge were already built and the last stage connecting bridge with Rositu will be included today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to fall.
A Fourth bridge project director Maikls Martins story: "The first link is a very important point for all bridges in the construction sector."
The first link to this fantastic project demonstrates the construction of supreme class engineering.
After the installation of the last stage and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were forced to connect the northern route with the land part or viaduktu.
This was done by hanging the north of the north 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and very delicate operation.
Milzis, the viadukts is 222 metres long, weighing around 6,000 tonnes and had to earn around 3%.
Deliked because tolerance in both directions worked with a team was only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything succeeded well.
Simona Bailsa won the gold exercise of gold in women.
There is a dead tension.
Dedequate mortality.
Simona Baills are all concerned about this.
Dinamically slowly.
Without effort, we are carrying out the exercise of a barrel.
Unable to sink.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday 19 years old American exercise broke golden medals, showing full differences between themselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total number of points in 62,198 was the head of the Supreme Court over silver medals and her team beet the Russian sportspeople, Alia Much the final result of the stays.
On Thursday, US sportsSimona Bailsa took the exercise of the celebration of the celebration of the celebration of the celebration of the Short sports campaign for women during the summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The nillas became the fourth Americans after a row, who won a multinational championship and the fifth best exercise, gradually reinforcing the reputation as the best of his generation exercise and possibly the best exercise. in the history of grossers.
When the end result was announced, she was disillusioned because the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement ranked him alongside unparalleled athletes such as Maikl Felps, who picked up its way of sport at another level.
Bailsa has dominated over the past three years in its sport, with 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling such excellent, accurate and ambitious exercise combinations that 1984 He called "the best exercise ever seen ever by the best exercise."
In Brazil, they expected the last test where she had to compete very much with hope that is to him and not with other athletes.
She was disappointed if she returned to his home in the rain, the Texte without gold medals.
US sports Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane is surrounded by the instigation of the sports exercise in individual multiplier mammets in the individual multipolar fugitive women in 2016, and Aliaken Raismane. the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medals Bailsa won Tuesday, making a special selection coordinator Marta Karolji refunctioned.
Although Bailsa claims that in their long journey to the label, there was nothing to wait, but it is not true.
Part of her prevalence free movement, which includes her special acrobic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would be splendid on the street next to the Rio Olympics.
It is not coincidence.
The girl adopted her parents when she was still silent and which was opened by the third house of the Eimia Eimia Eimia Burton on sports, where the Burmanman's ternary (i) it has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost many struggles since summer and victory series since the summer of 2013 and can continue as long as the Bailsa so desire.
Although the Mustafina was somewhat under the leadership of the Mustafina two rotation, it was only an illusion.
The bedrock and free movement - the part of the competition, where the Bailsa championed his championship, is still just ahead.
She raised the outcome of 15,433 on bankers and strengthened leadership on 15.933 free movements.
Raismane her mask, while she was expecting the results that were only the formality and his disgrace in the boat when his dream was written in his past. the book book.
The result of Raismanes was as little revenge for the four years old, when she shared the third place with Mustafinu, but lost the fight for bronze medals.
This time, 22 years old crew captain, which the Americans are called 'grandmothers', put forward convincing leadership.
In the holiday free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she could have been able to dedicate the air to the crowd.
Meanwhile, 19 years old Bailsas's virtual Twitter feature r, which she published this week, has already completely different meaning.
The 6 years old Mahajs Brauns will survive in Filadelphia.
He said that 6 years old had been shot in Filadelphia, saying that this is already the second sixth season that was shot this week in Filadelphia.
Children old CBS Filadelphia confirmed that it is Mahajs Brauns.
Parenparents say that Brauns was shot several times, including in the circus, the foot, rotation and cool, but there was still a conscious when he was gone to hospital.
His grandmother, Mr Deloresa Melendeza, told television: "His small body was simply a window of lots."
I cannot believe that.
In a critical situation, a hospital has been placed in a hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family informs that he will certainly recover.
He had to start in the first class at the local primary school.
Brauns is one of the four people sashot in the town of Jermy.
Three men were also appalled: two 29 years old men and one 32 year-old man.
CBS Filadelphia reports that one of 29 years old men is in a critical state, but the situation of the rest of the two victims is stable.
The canal message that the child was found in the front seat of the machinery near the 29 year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police investigate whether anyone was attacked.
CBS Filadelphia said that several shoes were most likely to be appalled by the investigation.
In the place of events, the Ship chrones, which belongs to different weapons, were found.
It seems that it has been a long horrific appalling.
Scraptes were found in the two pedestrian boats.
"So it looks like a number of armed shadows were present here, who were active in appalling," said Filadelphia's police chief Antonium Ginaldi.
Several homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has been detained yet and reports are reported that the police check the entries of the observer cameras.
During the horrific season, the spokesman was killed for a 6 year old girl, while she was in front of his house in the Vestoukleina district.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprits.
Why do we need Simona, Gabija and Lauria?
I call it an annual female Olympic Viegled Comandu for several reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer's Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three easy lats, Simona Bailsa, Gabija Dugread and Lauria Hernandeza inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also contains Alija Raismane, a Jewish and Medisona Kociana, which is Catholic.
Finally, this team is truly representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of the black and Latin American sportsmen in this sport.
The best exercise in the last four years is the American American origin of origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took up 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, the Gabija Dugread became the Olympic championship, and America could have laughed.
Now the world has seen unbelievable exercises by the triple World championship of Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza in unprecedented but meistarious vintage..
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth Americans after a row that has acquired gold medals in individual multitude of women.
Her team beaudrene Alija Raismane won silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different.
Simona, Gabia and Lauria entered the Olympic lecture like Alija and Medisona.
They are the 'Olympic Commemorate' because there will be only four athletes in the next Olympic exercise, and this is the last year of treasury Marta Karol.
In fact, exercise is costly for sport: Vingroers are mainly trained in private plaintic clubs and keep parents who pay for training, premises, trips, formastules, hotels (e) for training, sports and their families and other expenditure.
Most of these light-Latin clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, sportspeople are leaving all their trainers, and it is expensive and a long contribution to easy Latin families.
Eimia Burry and Megija Hainija, Laurian Hernandezas, has trained their sportsmen and women from both girls since both girls began to fly..
We must ensure young girls inspired by Simona, Gabia and Lauria, cheaper vinification training.
I established my easy Latin slowly organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is in Houlema, and we offer more than 15 000 young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercises, free of charge or at low prices, and we have also trained national and international championships.
In September we will find a branch in Detroit (in my home city) to enable local young people to know this excellent form of sport.
The Latin latslowly builds on the coordination of force, losants and body coordination, as well as training hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in an easy Latin slowly and it is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Alija, Gabia and Medison for an excellent 'Metale Force' showing the golden medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless new girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Dgerem Hanta's offer, the new doctors intend to take more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the differences in reaching agreement on changes in the treaty with the British Medical Association representatives, with 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors taking part in the vote.
In July, the Hants announced plans to conclude a treaty stating that NHS is in a precarious position and further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new treaty, which provides for changes in the conditions for night changes and weekend killings, in order to improve working conditions in the standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, BMA's new foreign representative Dr. Elna Makourta announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks ago, eight weeks before the first new foreign group will sign the new treaty, we must make progress because time is not enough.
BMA efforts to resolve the problem of the negotiations have been faced with the unwillingness of the government to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened despite the fact that last month, Dgeremijs Hants said that his doors are always open.
A gesture, Hanta, must act immediately, stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do so, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
Over the last strike, over 13 000 rutine operations and 100 000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while the nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had contributed to the piceth.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the differences in reaching agreement on changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work weekend in 54 000 new doctors subject to new contracts.
The Chief Executive Director of NHS, Daniel Mortimers, called for young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that the strikes do not solve anything but only increases pressure on busy workers and worry, create strikes and delays for patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have spoken with the new foreign committee and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues such as placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leaving school leaving and gender pay inequality Medical - shows that employers, England health education institutions and the Ministry of Health seriously want to implement an agreement concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products for 2 munds per day can reduce the risk of cruelty.
Thousands of patients who have been hearts could be treated with medicines on 2 munds per day because the official representatives recomment on them for more people and longer periods.
Anti-recalling medicines Ticagrelor reduce the risk of a rehearted exposure to humans with cruelty.
This medicinal product is already prescribed for 12 months after the hearts by reducing the risk of rehearts.
NICE represented this preparation for 4 years after the hearts to further reduce exposure to cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE currently under the auspices of NICE is currently in charge of using this preparation 4 years after the hearts to further reduce cardiovascular risks.
Every year around 140 000 people in England are witnessing the hearts and the fourth part is going through a rehearted or insult.
The carpet and insult causes the accumulation of fatty substances in heart sings in the form of enclosures.
If the dam burst, it can lead to thrombin, blocking blood flow to heart and causing hearts.
However, if thrombs are separated from cardiovascular walls, it can go further into blood and block blood access to brain drains, causing infarktu.
People who have been hearts are exposed to a greater risk of rehearts.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British firm AstreZeneca and marketed with the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombes.
The new NICE guidelines published today recomment to people to use 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months and 60 mg twice on a daily basis with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsona, Director of NICE Health Technology, explains that "despite being available for rehearts of medicines, more than a quarter of people who have had the hearts are going through another cruelor or insult, which often has grave consequences."
Fear from rehearts can have a negative impact on the quality of life of human life.
Evidence suggests that in Ticagrelor, a combination with aspirin effectively reduces the rehearts and infarkt risks for people who have already experienced it.
Provisional treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities for thousands of people who are therefore winners.
In view of the limited information on Ticagrelative or efficiency and safety, in particular the risk of assimilation, using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines shall not recomment for longer than that period.
Politcorrectness promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former Mayor of Economics mays Lutfurs Rahman was dismissed from office in relation to corruption.
The government report reveals that, as a result of political correctness, the culture of political correctness has brought a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
The former government minister Sir Eiki is critical of the police, election supervisors and the city councils, that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process, because 'fear insults ethnic and religious interests'.
The former Secretary of State, who has now become a leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at election stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should show a certificate of identity when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
Currently, voters must only indicate the name and address.
He even recommends that the votes cast by the votes cast their votes with a special tiny in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs also need to ensure greater protection, say Sir'said.
He considers that the press should provide greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The aim is not only to prevent fraud in elections, but also protect local authorities from more corruption and fraudulent cultures that go hand in hand."
The report commissioned Dauningstrite following a scandal in the city of the city of the city.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to cancel the Mayor of mayors' Mayor Lutfuru Rahmy from corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted the religious vision of his Muslim community and silence his critics, accused of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman managed his election campaign, with the guarantor of the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him."
About 300 votes were falsified or questioned because one person had voted on several occasions.
Sir Eriks said that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that, in particular, fraud is worrying in voting, where the oldest members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for the candidates selected for themselves.
Sir Espadid suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including proof of identity document, in order to clarify identity of the person.
His report says: "Evidence shows that members of vulnerable ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of candidates for the elderly, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is concern that the institutions do not pay attention to these problems due to political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be touched."
Sir Espadid set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to operate with votes cast in order to prevent 'votes'.
The report dealing with the Threnea Meja also calls for a more thorough verification of registration in order to prevent the use of voters in the area of immigration and benefit fraud.
Obsert the possibility of electing an identity document to the electorate before voting.
Separate voters' purchases with special tiny votes in order to avoid double voting.
A systematic check of the nationality of persons to verify that the person is entitled to vote.
A three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by correspondence.
To prevent political campaigning and activists working with votes cast mail and electoral circles to vote by correspondence.
To secure the police mandate for the polling stations.
To make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of individuals under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
To ban photographs in the polling stations.
To use only English (except Wales) for polling stations.
Increased training to ensure that the polling workers ensure that voters travel to the ballot box per one.

He tells us: 'The Court of Elections only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for activities linked to corruption and fraud'.
He strongly found guilty of a standard of criminal evidence based on unavoidable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient inspection of the mayors of the mayors' constituents' constituents in the polling stations.
Sir buildings indicate: "The court decision adopted last year is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as a parliament's homeland, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of institutions that fraud does not jeopardise this good reputation.

Protecting ourselves from firearms through Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it slightly safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in the tub from attacked by a firearm, we talked with the Maga Maga great meistar from New York Ronu Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you attacked the front or on the back, this video shows how to protect themselves and win the attacker.
Mizraki points out if the attacker attacked the back, then we need to get back to the edge in order to clearly see the attacker and avoid shot rhetoric.
Then the weapon must be fitted between my front hand and shoulder and lay the opponents in the face with his free elconi.
Then they'll come down with the circus and while attacking the singer, we must take him into the arm of the guns and stepped up with the weapon of the gun. against him or her.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar: avoiding shot trajectories must be avoided, a weapon must be avoided and that the maldaris cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon, and a siting must be taken over the crushed and must finally be taken up and stepped up by continuing to prosecute him.
Hearings?
You see videos to see how Mizraki is doing this.
But remember if you did not go to Krav Maga meistars, it is safer to deprive the robbers of his money.

President who remained in the shadow: Gustavam Earth - 145.
On Friday 12 August, it is 145 years since the second Latvian President Gustav Earth was born.
The Latvian state proclaimed the Latvian state, but unearned the first Latvian President of Latvia must be the last president of Chakal and pre-hit at the last President of Chakal Ulmage.
Nobody of our statesmen has so much defended democracy and the rule of law as the Earth, the Arnolds Auzzins spent ten years ago.
In the talks with the portal Delfi Auzzins underlines that the earth is one of the few politicians who have been in a sense of humour.
Others are always very correct.
He teaches this at all, today it could be like the Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was close to the nation," I said.
Today's politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Kārli Ulman as a good leader, but rarely know how unprepared he has been.
The only man who has denied the blatant was General BalLanguis.
Even if he is kindly and smarty in the bills, he was hysterical.
"Low with my humour sense and democratic life is going directly against the impression," said Auzzins.
Professor Aivars Stranga, Professor Aivars Stranga, Latvian University's Faculty of Faculty of Faculty of Faculty of the University of Latvia, agrees with Auzina's assessment on the Earth as a peaceful and counted statesman.
He also notes that the Earth has grown with respect for minorities, who regularly called on Jewish representatives to attend President Pali.
"At that time, it was not usual, after the Earth presidency Alberto Kussis took over this tradition," the historian said.
He was a silent and wealthy man who had long had to talk to become president.
He himself did not seek himself, simply not slava.
He was also quite critical because he did not know French, but he thought that he would certainly have to understand it.
"During the Presidency, French foundations were both taught," Stranga said.
The earth did not want to speak again enough to stand as a candidate, he did not hesitate at all.
In all respects, he has a very respectable personality in Latvia's history, already in serious position before the President was in serious office - he was very demanding.
At the same time, the Earth led the famous earth in the streets of Suvorova, 3, where the members of paints and dyes were found, in practical government talks in the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
It was not a great priest, but he did not object to him.
"In the private negotiations, it has sometimes said that it is the man who does not simulate him," Stranga said.
There was no suspicion of illegality or corruption in a peaceful life.
How does the earth remember this nowadays?
It is a pity, but for a large part he associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, the views were centrally.
"During his time, there were no big shocks, that is, he could associate with a real stable Presidency," Stranga said.
During the course of the Lostava Earth presidency, from 1927 to 1930s, Latvia's country visit to Sweden, which has indirectly implied its full recognition to the neighbouring country and the integration of northern Europe in the family of the northern Europe, was also taking place.
On 28 May 1929, the country visited the country in Stockholm.
The Swedish troops Gustava V's visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian President of Latvia was born in 1871, but went on in January 1939.
Simply ways of helping to cope with dusma slowly.
I am often faced with the fact that the anger of the child is considered to be wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, 'Econet' points psychoe Jekaterina Kesa.
Specialist is encouraged to negotiate a little negotiating on these such natural and human feelings - duss and niknums that everyone has periodically experienced.
Agresion - it is already a physical activity addressed to another person, and it usually appears to be dusceptible.
When we adults are, we are angry, anxious - usually know what is happening with us and how to deal with it.
We can say our dusm and niknies in the face: to say, to suppress, hide, keep the face, tell you about their friends or other proximity, we can throw away the strange of dirty., to praise cigarettes (is not the best way to dispel dusm!), walk down, slip down the table and do other things that are usually not done.
We are not addressing our aggression against others, because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are searching for anger, do not understand what is happening with them, how they name and how they live.
They can say: 'leave!', 'You're silly', 'Slict mamma', 'I see't see you', 'I'm not friendly' - and very rarely, when I can say: 'I am angry. "
Children live in literally, they are fully here, at this time, they are spontaneously and indeed in their feelings, and often find themselves in different emotions.
It is very important that the parents of parents do not ban the feeling of feeling, including anger, not to shame on it and do not care, but, on the contrary, to help the child.
Did things have been done in relations?
A long working day, in which everything has not happened quite simply, would like to be a bad feeling - there are so many reasons why I would like to see a moment, day or even longer, from all over the world.
Is it possible to have relations with a little while and a little breathing?
Or, though, does it show that each of our partners is going to go?
In my opinion, gentlemen, there are differences in old age.
Jānis (23) is short and succinct: 'In my opinion, if there is a need for a passport, you do not belong together with the real man'.
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has revealed a scheme which, perhaps, can help someone.
If you feel that a partner is beginning to fall on the nerve for each small detail, then surely it is the right moment to study other media fields to understand if you lack your teeth. or, in particular, do not intend to see him or even if he or she is no longer willing to see him any longer.
So the answer is: yes, it can help save time and understand how important you have the other half.
Kaspars (29) reveal their theory.
In my opinion, relations must be held on one another every day, because, if you spend time with the people 24 hours at night, seven days a week, then the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I am doing every detail that the other is doing, and it is starting to fall on nerve.
People are beginning to burn each other, especially when there is no longer anything else about what you have done on the day.
My personal experience is to think so, so I have not been able to have a relationship for longer than a couple of months.
If you think at some point about the fact that somebody else or at the other is better - then why is this woman, with whom you're together, deserves one who can think that there is not enough good and beyond the mountains. are rural havens?
Thinking alone is a small levy.
If there is no, then there is no.
"I have, so it is a little fine for those who do not have" say Edic Edmunds (46).
The word (33) is completely contrary to the opinion.
It seems to me that everyone needs time for breathing space.
You could not die every moment, all the time, from morning to night, watch each other in the eye and curve the love of love.
Drivers!
There are so many things: friends, work, balstites.
Everyone has its time.
Of course, also friendship or wife, but if both can keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live up to the captain.
That is true and only it.
Mārtiņš (27) tel: "Be to say - need or not, may or should not be taken up, but one thing is clear: it does not exist in relations until the end of its relationship, something that."
If this issue is levied, then it will be necessary to assume that in the near future there will be any change - good or bad half - depending on the same.
I think, while there is a new and a trak, it is always necessary - not all the time, but when everything remains serious and relations are going in another phase, then rest cannot be made.
You decide, however, to spend all life together!
"If you can't withstand each other and every one every time we need a breathing, then who will be retired, who comment on how long mejotic cats or disputes about it?, in which the garden is better worded," explains Kristaps (19).
All the words have been changed.
With my enthusiasm and enthusiasm, Rozental was the first waken of the latent's interest in the arrogant arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the lator's nation, which will remain unforgotten," he said in Rome, a Latvian glezal Jani Rozental Jani Rozental, at the time in Rome. Need Suta.

German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the Communist miles of former East Germany could be much higher than previously believed, but doubts about the actual number of victims are still not dispelled.
According to the data published on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall, the museum of the Berlin Wall in Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with western allies and the subsequent assassination of the Communist authorities of Western Germany 1.1841 people who tried to get out of their controlled territories.
The vicinity of border related deaths has been studied for years and the number of victims corrected every time.
This year, 11 deaths are added to the list, including among the victims of a six-year-old boy that drowned, the family attempting to become West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The new Berlin Wall is also victims of the Soviet army delaser.
"The final damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said Alexander Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the captains of those who died trying to escape from Communist controlled state are serviced and dismissing," the statement of Hillary Hillary said in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The harmful 1841 is unconvincing," said Süddeutsche Zeitung, an expert in East Germany's history of East Germany.
He is currently reviewing alleged suspected deaths at the border with other researchers from Berlin, and only 260 cases have been approved so far.
In the past, researchers estimate that only the Berlin Wall murdered 138 people.
In view of those who have died in trying to flee the Baltic Sea or to join the West via neighbouring countries, according to this point, the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However, it is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all the suicides of East Germany border guards, regardless of whether they were directly linked to their services.
Muzeum shall also address the death of death other than direct violence.
"If the Seniori aged 70 to 80 after the collapse with border control died from the hearts," the illdebrante is considered to have the consequences of this' murderous border '.
However, it is convinced that the distinction needs to be made between the old people who might die as a result of their experience, and those who have caused a prolonged waiting time at the war on the bus at the border.
Regardless of the list of victims, it is not easy, since the Communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and researchers need to choose documents in different classic archives.
However, this group has recently passed new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone to Rio de coach accreditation; it is surprising.
In recent days, the president of the Latvian Latvian Pelding Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone Rioon-Janeiro arrived at the Olympic Games with training accreditation, but feel surprised.
On Wednesday, a wide range of newspapers were due to the remarks made by Germans Jakubovska on the Olympic ash Aalon Ribakova, who revealed that at the last minute in Rio de Janeiro decided proceed to Pone while the training must remain at home.
The first list was confirmed by the grey Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins, a coacher of Jakubovsky and Deivs, as well as the federation president Pone.
The Latvian Pelding Federation said five participants in the Olympic Games, and yet before departure, Aldon Vrublelevskis said that Germans will and he is searched for tickets.
"However, obviously for objective reasons he was not," said Pone, saying that it did not affect the Ribakov result.
At the request of the federation, Uvja coach took her helping her.
The one who himself is a member of the executive committee of LOK has been sharply criticised by the operation of LOK, leading to the over-monitoring of the organisation of the Olympic sport.
In my view, it is unethical in the executive committee of LOC to approve five persons and one of them not to take.
"I don't know why there was no room for Pelding federation," Pone said that the Society did not assess the work of federations and their President, recalling that the presidents do not receive salaries.
He also criticised the Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved between participants, he appeared in the International Water Federation (FINA) and called for Latvia would not send any athletes to sport.
One could not tell us why he is in the Olympic Games with the accreditation of the coach, which is likely to be due to Yakubovskim.
"Bia Applications as a federation president (" team leader "), but for some reasons, I received a train accreditation and now nowhere near the inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditation changes.
So far, I think Germans will have, because there was no other information I had.
After the information held by LETA, a couple of days before the Ribakova Ribakova, she had converted with Poni with Poni and then had the bathers in his eyes, but the President of LPF said that it was an everyday conversation with a desire to mould athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five types of sport in the Olympic Programme and four of them are also training children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that in Latvia, it is very important to have drowning issues and also have spoken about programmes, in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 Latvia could address the World Cup.
The Rio Skioon-call is not my leave, I worked here, spent my time and trying to implement the four-year programme.

For its part, the national environmental service shall decide on the scale and nature of the compensation on the basis of that expertise.
Latvia's annual annual compensation amount for the recovery programme for fish resources amounts to EUR 1 035 000.
In spring 2016, Latvia, in cooperation with the association, "We fish" in the fifth year, 400 artificial fish spaces in Daugav near Kaibalas and Sir.

Calais prefect's office pointed out that these self-founded companies should be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as the risks of fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the ECHO explained that these small businesses are essential because food provided by governments and support groups does not guarantee the needs of the camp where the number of residents continues to rise.

Britain was a fascinating affair for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of the Raise, they lost all games at the regain-7 series in Adetrane.
This time they lost only one game.
Save is painful, but growth is astonishing.
Fiji has been impressively embarking on mackets, revitalising the British strength's methods.
This was the result of a series of busy buses and the World Cup championships, with 5: 0 when Osea Colinisau received the first low.
In the last four minutes, Jerijs Tuwai, too, has further increased the majority in the right wing.
The result is 12: 0 and the British team were not even affected by bombs.
The pattern of power has not allowed Leoni Nakaravam to make three points, but it only had a little impact on Fiji's outcome.
In the seventh minute, Jasa VereMalua received a landing in the right-wing corner by strengthening the UK to 17: 0.
After the game, Nakarava has further increased the weights and had remained more than a minute before the end of the first half of the year.
The report was adopted with 570 votes in favour, 16 against and 10 abstentions.
The result provided for 29: 0.
Fiji in Fiji has been born to play in a regain-7 macos while British only learns.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team did a profound change at lunch by breaking the Fiji players line... Four four minutes after the first half of the standards were good until the time when Dos Tuisova, after fantastic team matches scored a few points for Fiji's team.
Denam Norton managed to find points for the British team in the left-left corner and reaching 36: 7, but the game was lost, while South Norval fans had lost, Vice-President flags and dejoja tribins.
Fiji's life is not unadmirable.
Mata Viliame made Fiji victory even freer with another low landing at the end of the game.
Fiji could start to celebrate at the end of the game, but the British, after defeat, was able to sit down.
In the first half of the day, Fiji carried out Japan with the results 20: 5, while the British was over to South Africa where both teams got down in the bag and south-phrase. They only lost only a few points.
At the first lunch, Kail Brauns was nominated by Boks in team, but in the second half of Dens Norton with shining meistarism crossed the line and brought bumbs between stable and britants. victory.
Markusa Vatanen, who is part of England's regain-15 team's Antonium brother, was at the end of the game at the end of the game and another silver medal.
Trenera's fight against cancer inspired Helena Glover and Heteri Standing win in airing competitions.
It will be an emotional golden meshare in these clashes, and it is already being expressed.
From the first to the last storm, the Staningas Place of Helena Gloveres and Heteres's gold was a particular importance for the Estacio da Lagoa trawl.
Although there is only two sportspeople in boat, she spent Robina Viljamsa, who inspired her inspired up to the second Olympic gold of golden women in reairing for women, becoming the first Women in the history of British sports, who have achieved such success.
They were unquestionably dominated, because 39 times they were not able to win, an unprecedented victory.
The two big athletes of men drove down the water surface with the surface, not entirely reflect this triumph.
Behind each of the gold gold in the airside, the airside is standing hard to work hard to continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success by coach, who did not know 30 months ago, or living days, because he was found to be a cancer.
After his words, it disappeared as quickly as demonstrated.
I was a man of urry, who is one of those who can operate and that was what happened.
If not, it would spread by all the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
This is a little change in your vision.
Visit cancer was launched in December 2013.
This trio pains that the recovery was able to start the recovery procedure early in 2014 and reduce the length of interruptions to a minimum if it can be said.
I had a need for income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in hospital and I went over 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, although the doctor said that some steps would be enough.
All of this started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After victory, the first idea was immediately about a Vilame, who had very disturbed and worry over the morning more than usual.
Standing, which has been the date of the Royal Artilera Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional week, but it means a great deal to me."
This only confirms how much this means and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The 3 years of Helena and Robin have been excellent.
Without Robina, we would not have achieved anything, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better coach member or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Hetere Standing over five years have not lost any race.
It is reaching such a huge speed, with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to get closer, the overweight of Staninges and Gloveres was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helena kprohibited: "Maintains rolling stock rolling."
It is really important that we do not lose sight.
We managed to get a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On this day, we did not have the intention to dump record, but simply to rock and win the race and we did so.
The rest of the year will rest in order to decide what to go further.
The next month will be the Stliala Bashala Bashala of Glover and TV.
For the time being, she simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed some six months to understand that I am the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it needed some four minutes.
She said: "Bread is fantastic."
The possibility of looking at Losandgelour Central Library fantastic architecture is an opportunity.

"The cogova VID manager" will drive until the last. "
Following his words, now Prime Minister Kuucinskim (Greens / Farmers) and Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai (Greens / Farmers) already exists "principally It is important that the candidate nominated by the Revenue Service has been appointed to Collegova of the Finance Minister.
Rajevo estimates that both Kuucinskim and Reizniecei-Ozolai in this government are "the first big decision," which can affect him as a future politician.
If the position is now to change the position of the candidates for selecting the Revenue VID, it will have a negative impact on their immotage state administration.
The President of the Cabinet of Ministers is on the agenda for the next week's sitting of VVD chief Kolegova, as Director General of the Revenue Service, shows the government's agenda.
The chief leader of Kolegova VID directed finance minister Reizniece-Ozola, following the resignation of the Service's post Inar Petersone and when a tender for the post of Director General of the Revenue Service expired without the result.
The Head of the Revenue Service Manager Dace Pelbuilding on Thursday, 11 August, in the interview, the Latvian Radio allowed her to stand as a leader, then she could agree.
At the same time, the Finance Minister admitted that the other candidates for the chairperson of the Revenue Service were not currently considering the other candidates for the chairperson of the Revenue Service.
Mr Raivis Dzintars, leader of the Saeima group, admitted that he was still supporting Kolegova under the authority of the Revenue Service.
In Spain, the potential to reduce deficits is threatened by the failure to set up a government.
Before 12 July of the month, the European Commission (EC) came forward with an opinion that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the deficit level by the Euro Zone 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
According to estimates, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's deficit was 4. 4% of GDP last year, while Spain is 5. 1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while setting fiscal objectives for the immediate time.
One of the reasons why the EC, however, did not impose sanctions against both countries, is the growing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiment.
Critics indicate that the EC has not been consistent in its decisions from the outset on uniform rules and subsequently unable to apply them into practice.
This is why, for example, President of the German Bundesbank, Jenss Veidmans, said that Europe is losing confidence in itself, giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendations rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States approved extending the deadline for correcting the budget until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission is promising to examine progress made in both countries over the next few months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be achieved in due course and already this year's deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government must implement austerity measures 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional focus on the control of costs of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year's deficit should be reduced to 4. 6%, next year to 3. 1% next year and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures for the next two years should be 0. 5% of GDP every year.
In particular, the achievement of these objectives makes it a fact that eight months ago, Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the formation of the government, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to have been able to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in the year.
However, the opinion polls show that the third elections in the political landscape in the country would not change significantly.
The Popular Party is still the party of the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, a party led by the Prime Minister, whose elections would once again receive less than 33% of votes.
The popularity of its own popularity has only been multiplied by Socialists, while the austerity measures in Podemos, or 'Together, we can' and 'Ciudadanos', or 'Citizens', are somewhat popularity..
The People's Party wants to get socialist and Ciudadanos to be involved in the government even this month, otherwise it will not succeed until mid-October and submit to the European Commission for endorsement of the 2017 draft budget.
As a representative of the parliamentary factory of the People's Party Parliamentary factions, Rafael Hernando, if the government is not going to set up and parliamentary elections, it will also be for third time, Spain will become a laughing of all Europe.
Decladen purity in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
On the fifth anniversary of the beaches, the activists conclude that the number of waste recovered is unfortunately increasing annually and the majority of bathing sites are responsible here.
The most polluted bathing sites are directly Riga.
Capital councils explain that bathing sites were saved every day, but to fight unclean visitors are very difficult.
In addition, waste in droughts can be washed in water during the rainfall, thus greatly damaged by its quality.
In the case of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches in other places in Latvia is critical.
This week, the volunteers of the campaign 'My Sea' campaign have been disseminated this week.
The fifth anniversary of the road along Riga, the activists conclude that the number of waste left per hundred metres has increased per hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year, this is a critical assessment.
"We can see that this will be a year when the number of waste per 100 metres per 100 metres can even exceed 200 units," Janis Ulme said.
Latvian Radio Brocalls, he came in the immediate beache, where a voluntary march along Riga seals will continue.
This year, there were activists between different municipal waste and piknic activists to collect even fluorescent lamps left in the sea sands.
The pedestrians and organiser Ulme test, polluted directly citizens.
"The main source is for the beach visitors themselves, since more than half of total waste is plastic, different waste, from bags, plastic parks that are already depleting, no longer It is impossible to identify and smoke, bottles, corkers, tells Ulme.
Incidentally, bathing sites are among the top beaches.
For example, almost 800 waste units have been collected every hundred metres per hundred metres per hundred metres, which are critical.
The organisers of Campaign also explain that they also smoke every step, and not the signs of warning or prohibition at all.
"Average figures for all three bathing sites together - Daugavgrsive, VVgavgrsive, Vaccarbul and Aold - unfortunately sanction large and far above the desired or target to which Latvia is moving until Latvia is progressing. In 2020, a reduction in the number of waste units to 135 units" concludes the environmental defender.
Cleaning the cleaning in Riga on a daily basis, even twice in the summer's warmest days, explains the domicile of Uogis Vidauskis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"They consume alcohol, smoke and do all things that can not, even special signs, do not work," said Average audience.
On average, therefore, calls on bathing visitors to report the pollutants to the police as well.
A police may be called the police, to indicate these violations and in this way all fight against them.
Perhaps there may be any new warnings, but, as I said, it is hardly the case that the situation will change.
"As everyone together simply needs to address and be intolerant against such offenders," he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements for the fourth time this summer has been carried out by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
Today, the situation is that all 56 bathing areas have been good for all the time and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"For the last time, we will take the analysis at the end of August," the oldest specialist for environmental health, Normunds Kadiķis, said.
Records of heavy rainfall can be wasted in water during the rainfall.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, indicate an environmental professional.
Rotation in Russian elitts will continue, Putin's change of administration.
Don't leave the post?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov left his office himself and will continue to be a Special Representative for the Natural Protection, Ecology and Transport of the President.
In announcing changes, Putin's enthusiasm in front of Ivanovam's acknowledgement: 'Cienian Sergej Borisvič, we are working with you for many years together and doing so successfully'.
I am pleased to see how you are carrying out your duties.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this presidential administration for more than four years.
I therefore raise awareness of your desire to change the rural activity.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new position.
However, it is highlighted that the administration of President administration is a very important position and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of Russia's forthcoming elections next month, rumours have been rumoured that this step relates to the fight for power in Russia's political elites.
Ivanov was also called a substitute for a substitute president, so the statement that he himself wanted to take office in matters of natural protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to Lsm.lv archives, Ivanov is a Chief Officer of GDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been sens and close to the allies of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He was launched in 1965, where he was familiar with Putin.
Later, Putin became a deputy head of security service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President Boris Jerzy Buzek was killed on the Russian Security Council Secretary.
In 2000, after Putin's subsequent arrival, the Ivanova developed "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, including in Russia the revival of public censorship mechanisms.
In 2002, Sergei Ivanov became a Russian defence minister, but already in 2005, Mikhail Fradkova, Prime Minister's Mikhail Fradkova, was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after the resignation of President Obama, Ivanov will also retain the seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President of President Administration will also work.
The picture comes from the family council elitts.
The head of the President's administration, Vaino, has said himself as Ivanov.
We are familiar with Antonu Eduarvić long ago.
Even from those times when your leadership was working in the government.
And for the past almost five years, we have been working practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that after all professional and personal qualities he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The picture comes from a family that belonged to the elites of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karls took up senior posts in Estonia's Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, the first Secretary.
The media "Meduza" with a reference to a book "Estonia's self-determination and independence" writes that, at the end of the 80s, Karls Vaino asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he has received a refusal and has lost office soon.
In the aftermath of this, the Waino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has both pledge Moscow's International Institute for International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has gone away from the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Minutes.
It has already been said that last ungifted Russia has been shaken by a number of high-ranking officials and even arrests, including replacement guarantors and federal representatives of several areas.
According to polyitologi, President Vladimir Putin resettled the ruling elites before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing frequency of structures of force for senior positions.
The judo has also lost the way in the first fight of the Olympic Games.
This was the fight in the first round, and Latvia's judo has fought for its participation in the Olympic Games by finalising the finger on 17.
The Basque Basque Basque Basque Latvian Television said that Niziforenko's hope was very little, and it has already been clear before the race.
He also found that the judo was fighting his shoulder in the fight.
It is remarkable that, in order to reach the Olympic trips, the Newcastreniforenko had to start into another weight category than was assigned to the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani genocide was 25 kilograms heavier.
Jevgeony Borodavko in the Borodavko championship to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki's two and a half minutes in the fight against Rjunosuki, a winning daughter.
So Latvia has concluded its judo competitions.
The horses disappeared in Rio smile.
Judium Jevgeony Borodavko was inaugurated on Thursday.
Yes, he had a tiighter opponent against him, but the ambitious times are sometimes surprising.
He did not miss him.
It was even more difficult in the Artoikiforenko's task, because the experience of less and opponents will also respect the respect.
The next thing is that he held a half a half a minute for more than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, the Latvian judists are suffering the most.
He went on to say that "the Golden Score is no longer the Golden Score," he said, "Golden Score," he said, "Golden Score," Things are moving around the downward curve.
Mr Jackevich, who advises Kazakhstan's judium here, and the Vsevolt Zothi Zoony does not see me.
But if you don't grow, there will be no.
And it is a federation prerogative.
So, as the President of the other gallery, Rite panorama was a pledge of the President of Latvia, the President of the Latvian Federation of Latvia, to fight the medals of the Rio.
The flight is far from reality.
Looking at the beaches of the beaches, Samoilovs / Schmodiņš - Evané / Pee Solbergs, was wasted in the evening.
Intriga as the 'death' group - lost games.
Latvia's dueager was a little retreat - it could also lose, but not more than four points in two faces.
The tense was still blowing off the former game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling above the storm's cort was over the whole mask.
The wind-up wind of the game caused additional complications.
The beginning pretends that it could be ours - which is more comprehensive - ally.
But it was not.
The Latvian duetus was quite simply playing here.
It is so on Samoilova and waiting for him to plunge.
Canada was plunged down, against Cuba at the end of the first six and at the beginning of the third beginning, because the load was not by a joke.
It could have been angling at that time, because there was little work, but when it was, it was done to pay it.
Driving Samoilovs was able to win two faces with this mode, because the first took the lead with 16: 15, but also 16 remained below the limit.
But it could also be lost with 0: 2, because the second sixth deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third was already riting Evancane.
The seidoted chain - unconvincingly accepted, "the second game often lido far too close to the network and Samoilovam remained very few options for a fruitful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilovs in the field of Cubans, then he worked more smoothly, and it would only be unprofessional for me to get lost.
The Kremlin was mistaken and herself symbolically that the last bomb blockade was just him.
Look at the team.
This time, there was certainly a lack of success: the third six only two Evané attacks were almost flying out of corta, but the bumber was still affected.
Two eisi was along the line.
The controversial episode of the video was also a good opponents.
If you were in the first two games, Evané mofought with sercanm, then they were very productive against ours.
Total aggregated lost on tobacco.
The causes of failure now need to be analysed calmly.
Maybe it should have been a lot of life alongside the stadium, not together with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It went on two and a half hours.
Perhaps a little self-confidence came from the seven semi-half-hearted series.
Perhaps Kitgenfurt was not to play, but to come here faster and better accustomed.
Perhaps there was a failure to find a virtual form of athletes.
So far more than answers.
Our bishops are over.
Conclusion on medals.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup turns and also the Jurmala Masters.
It has never been friends and there will be no doubt with Samoilova in life because there are too different personalities.
But this is not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise because the blame will be sought not only in sevée but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to distinguish, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a decent partner.
The two brothers are playing bishers, but Janis with Tomu has already tried and homeland, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start to win the world's superior..
Harbedu Regime, Alexander Solovees, Edgar Toy, return to Mārtitian Padows, but it will not be better than that, which was not once demonstrated at the stages of the World Cup.
The Pakistanaban smile did not smiled for them this time.
And everything.
Of course, it must also be taken into account that the beaches of beaches are becoming more popular, new across and only the real rise is less than two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success, but it is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Nowadays, today's longest remains.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to wear the places offered by the organisers and choose their choice.
The US basketball is living on a cruise ship, a part of the tennis outside the Olympic village.
Similarly, part of the beaching voyage has been screened in the hotel Kopact.
This time, for journalists who have been offered to journalists quite modest smelens were demanding a heavy overhead of prices.
That is why the choice fell to the Irish Irish.
Risks are, because sometimes they can be inconvenient from the logistical point of view.
This time the risk justifies.
Jointly with the lesson of Vladimir Paririroviich, the border of the Kopact and Ipanemas.
Declared 200 metres at the distance, a bish-like lunch in a walk.
Rajon pasture safe because favelas paternity, but there is no need to lose sight of it.
Vladimir Vladimir Putin is not what some times imagined, but the most professional journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
On Friday morning, another medals dream was dreamed in the morning morning.
In 100 metres barriers to the barriers and high temperatures of Laura Ikauniece-Admidn, the Admidn resistes from his personal record.
But there are still five discipline.
After 10 years' Porgijs and Besa 'in Liepaja.
Latvia was operating in Porgijs and Beslan early 1973 in Latvia's National Operation.
Since then, the internationally recognised sdose has not yet been reveiled.
This is why the organisers of the Arst Festival Festival and Liepaja Arts Forum in close cooperation have decided to give steners the opportunity to enjoy the Glake of George Glavina.
"We are very pleased that after a decade break, when the Liepaja was able to enjoy operational studies last time, this great George Gera Gmbšvina, Porgijs and Besa. The hopeful version is enjoying us in the new, newly-open concert, Lielais Mottars, said Baiba Bože, head of the concert.
The "Porgijs and Besa" is in a spiral language story on love, its volatility, passion, as well as life tragedies and ordinary everyday walls.
It reflects the vitality, music and rites of the afro-American.
This is precisely the lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so lively.
"And yes, this love is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way deep," he said.
What I like most, listening or reconciling this operation, always contains stopping points: famous melodia, famous motives, but these transition from one other to another, By highlighting one personal or other personal or orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this building," the operative head of the Porgijs and Beslan musical leader and dirrestrent Andris Poga.
Operators are in agreement that this is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear the famous Gera operation in the world.
It is soudly that the Liepaja can feel a world helpine.
"The executive professional" shall be assessed by the visitors' Edgars Lami.
The concert was a special reflection of the newspaper "Lielais engines" for the first time in orchestra bedré, orchestra and for the first time operating concert behaviour..
In the name of the Masslas Museum, the buildings restored by Jata Rozental could be named.
Riga Vice-President Andris America said in the opening of Rozental felt that a museum of his own address could not be a matter of criticism in the future, rather than the 10a of the Krišjāan Valdemar Streear. Table 1 Rozental fields 1.
Mache's director Mar Lorce admitted that the transfer of the address would lead to a Russian-bureaucratic bureaucratic burden, but generally welcomes this idea and therefore agreed to the municipalities proposal.
A Riga city of its kind has put this idea into the 1936.year by setting up the Burkarda Dzeal monument Janim Rozental, who is on the museum.
The former director in Vilhelms was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In that way, this further activity could be purely logical.
For me, I am a little crushing the conscience, but the Vilhelms Purvince, where we are going to put his name?
"But if you, America, you promise to think," said Logistics.
It was said that the National Arts Museum building was officially opened in May this year after an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation of its doors.
This week, the VEF Cultural Palace of Cultural Castle will finally begin.
A total of around €11 million will be updated for the 'Welve' of the SIA.
A number of Castle rooms, including two viewers, as well as to adapt buildings to people with reduced mobility, are planned to be renovated.
The Riga City Council intends to attract €6 million to the project for European Union funds, but the director of Riga City Council Oleg Burov recognises that, for the time being, there is no complete clarity for the project on European funds.
"Regardless of the political will to launch the VEF Cultural pilij repair works by linking the European Structural Funds, we expect a decision, real action from the Ministry of Finance, real action from the Ministry of Finance, it will be money or no," says Bucharest Flavour.
Last December we told us that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that it takes the decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
Now we see that another discussion is emerging again, now we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and concluded within the deadlines," Burovs said.
As reported, more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Palace of Culture was collectively organised by a group of participants before the start of the refurbishment of the next building.
Although the year passed, renovation of buildings was still not started and collectively continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the Riga City Council strategy, the EF Cultural Castle of Culture Castle is split into a seemingly independent transformation of works, where everyone will ensure the implementation of different Palace functions.
First: Increasing access to cultural Palace of EF Cultural Castle and Storage of the surrounding area.
It provides for the orderly treatment and engineering, as well as to restore the prepacked of the building.
Second: improving the supply of services of the EF Cultural Centres of Culture.
It plans to improve the interconnector, walls and turns of buildings, insights and sound recordings for studies, as well as to put building house in-house engineering.
Third: improving collective working conditions of Creative amateur, which includes plans to improve workshops equipment, heating and ventilation systems.
Prior to the 'Lives' 40, a legitimate rock group can get acquainted in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover different "Llius" items - photographs which have been arranged in the time line to reflect the group's activities by 2010 when notified of the group's performance.
There will also be a list of participants' watchdogs, music tools, awards and concerts, as well as other major publications still unseen cases reflected in the 'Lower' creative activity of the group.

Musicians have also been associated with the group "Llii" and their relatives, responsive to the appeal and shared both subjects and memory.
The first beginning of the term "Lives" in 1972, when the Liepaja Culture House was created in a vokal instrument in an ancillary ansamblis led by Juris Pavitol.
In the Ansamblis it was part of the festival's Liepaja engines in 1972 and 1974 as well as town and republic.
In 1971, the fate of the man took place when Juris Pavtols took the floor with the Easter Body in Blogi and the Metalurry culture was set up by a group to join Ingrids Gmanman, Andri Kruma news and Ji Grodness.
Over the years, the group's composition has been manned not only once.
Participants have joined, others have taken their path, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to demonstrate that Latvian rock music is able to live and survive - remains unchanged.
"What is missing: gentlemen, hair, hair and bardini, these boys alarmed away from the generotype of the general elabordog, the group says, the group says the music viewer. Recruitment.
Examples of musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Russians, Modris Shterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rheik, Modris Rhegane, Tel. Pusbarer, Ainars Virga, Aivars BrParis, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.

Last year I focused on the Pope Franciska encylicai, Laudato si and updated the common house, the Earth's theme in Latvia.
This year, of course, I watched what is happening in the world and trying to respond to it.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the quasi-powered cancer must be put at the heart of life.
It needs to be shown that the blame is responsible for the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration to move forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But I will say, Lamps in the discussion, you said that 'return to awareness of the pilots'.
What do you understand?
Does this mean that man has prevented a church from the embassy?
And today is a return resource for a church?

The explanation of applying the candidacy of the standing coalition in relation to the controversial coalition in the coalition is to be linked to the fact that she has prevented the government's criticism.
In a short conversation with LETA told LETA, he would find it hard to imagine that next week the United States would support Kolegova's candidacy at the government meeting next week.
This would lead to government demissions if the 'Unity' votes were voted against, while Kolegow was so approved.
The expert considers that Kolegova has been consulted before announcing the candidacy of Kolegova, both with finance ministers, Ms Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mars Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a concession to 'Unity' which was strongly opposed to her candidacy.
When it comes to finding suitable candidates to find suitable candidate, the Skudra admitted that there are two options: either a compromise figure, or an institution as a Deputy Director General, will continue to lead Dace Pelethical, as Director General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Finance Minister so far claimed that there is no other candidacy, it was a household in the Pelbuilding that it should not be part of the tender.
As reported, the head of the National Environmental Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the Revenue Service.
As a result of the 'consensus', the government postponed the appointment of Kolegova on Tuesday in his capacity as Director-General of the Revenue Service.
Following the decision of the government, the decision to postpone the decision by Kolegova confirmed that it is still prepared to become a Head of VID.
At the same time, thought was changed: on Friday, the Finance Minister Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai indicates that he withdraws his consent to transfer his consent to the Revenue Service and that she had no easy choice.
Prime Minister Mar Kučinska's press secretary Andrei Vaivars told LETA that a new competition will be organised on the vacant post of the vacant Revenue Service.

The media reveal a redesign phase.
The Latvian National Traffic Secretary, Uldis Augulis, the Latvian Latvian National Traveller (LVC), as well as representatives of the construction agency SIA Binders and local representatives today opened a state-constructed country's main road Russian border (Grebles) (bona) -Resekne-Daugavpils border (Medlis) (A13) from the Medal to Lithuania's border (156.4-163,05 km).
The road maps are the country's visit map, especially border routes, and therefore special satisfaction is to reveal the reconstruction of the frontier with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the European Union funds, the situation on national roads is improving.
"As predictions show, the funds available during this programming period will be released in 2018 and we need to think about maintaining the most busy road roads in a very good quality, and also to ensure citizens' mobility in all Latvian regions without European Union funding." Returning the symbolic lended to Uldis Augulis.
The minister also pointed out that the proposals made by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented in the government at an early stage.
In the course of the works from the hunt to Lithuania's border (156.4-163,05 km), SIA Binders started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of Reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstruction phase is a fully renovated road design and will start repairs next year from the Medal to Daugavpilij, so that all the road from Lithuania's border will be sorted up with it." Daugavpilij, "said Mr Janis Lange, President of the LVC board.
The main motorways of the country are the most busy and until 2018 we are planning to ensure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by providing timely maintenance and replacement of ashalt surfaces every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all of them will look forward to the proposals made by expert groups to adjust the road financing system," she said.
As part of the project, interconnections and lighting at the heart of the Medare are arranged.
Successive ground works: in four phases, large amounts of large scale recordings and bulk recordings and embankment work smoothly, which has so far been very uneven.
Renewed public transport places and reconstructed a return to public transport.
In the past, there were insufficient unstowable unstowable instincts and areas that were not transparent due to the mountainous arrival, as well as the old road of a common topography.
The next building season is scheduled to restore the motorway from the city of Daugavpils City up to the reconstruction stage (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC intends to carry out different types of work more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
For all repairs planned on the national road network this year, the information is available on the LVC homepage www.enceli.en.uk.
"In order to achieve the desired results, the choice of combinations of food products is very important," the Lithuanian Diethology Laura Romeraite-Colieriene said.
In addition, it is easy to welcome during the summer period when our own gardens grow fruit, ovens and vegetables.
The combination of deliberate nutrition products can help not only reduce overweight but also to purposedly promote the various organism processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, because there is a lasting sense of sense and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition magazine have shown that vinegar has a positive influence on the blood of glucose and helps us to feel encouraging.
Coaic pipari and protein rich edient, such as poultry or the cocktail cocktail of protein, creates not only a sense of susceptible but also reduces the cards after large males They will be on the next edition.
Such a combination of ethical events is also capable of increasing the amount of incineration incinerated by maltine by up to 35%.
Studies show that Kajena pipari can help to get rid of the fats of the fats.
The substance contains substances that are environmentally friendly - cholin, while papric is a good source of vitamins.
With a sufficient amount of these nutrients, the cortisation levels can be reduced, with fat accumulating around the middle of the body.
A bottom-up bottle, accompanied by fresh ogas, is yet another taste and fats for breakfast, which it is worth including in your medient.
Osnar couples and ogas contain fibre, which, according to the conclusions of the Canadian scientists, is controlled by grey hormones - and thus also the sense of hungry.
In addition, ports contain polyphenols, which are palled in weight reduction, as well as preventing fat formation.
Cotton and protein can also be able to do miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of creating a sense of sensitivity.
The vegetables contain water and fibre, which is why the sense of susceptible is encouraged.
At the same time, protein slows down the greening process and ensures a sense of susceptibility for a longer period.
In lunch, they can eat or prepare the obaldark cocktailers from a mixture and enjoy it together with their favourite vegetables.
No combination of product combinations.
There are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecular compounds.
On the other hand, starch in vegetables is polyaharid.
Fruit mechanically mechanically disaggregated, while chemically they dissociate until the third or fourth degree of greening takes place.
The victim is divided into three different stages starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the island immediately after maltine.
To build a free-day after maltine, it is' stuck 'with other meals where it is not chemically profitable and is beginning to work.
Do not eat potatoes, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers or other carbohydrate products, together with qurones, Happy, hopelesss, grey ananasans or other acids.
Entrol ptialine is only operating in a rosé environment.
Fruit acids hampers not only the removals of carbohydrates, but also contributes to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein rich the combination of product combinations at one day.
Their processing requires different digestive juice, each of them with different strengths, characteristics and time when it comes to the angle.
Arczs, medusmelone, foaflets and other melons should always be eaten separately from other meals.
The Melones are not being distorted if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuffs.
In combination with protein rich products.
The people make a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said about fat and protein - fat is hampered by the removals of protein.
Protein substances can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If large quantities of proteins are consumed, you will avoid fat use at all.
This also applies to freshness: it is not advisable to combine large quantities of nut (containing protein) with a whole source of fat (containing fat).
Such combination is hampered by an effective reduction in weight.
How to better prepare?
"Planning, thermic treatment causes significant loss of nutrients: around 15% to 55% of the original nutritional composition of products," indicate dietology.
In most cases, nutrients are being lost in water, poor food products.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods is increasing, precisely by weakening.
After the introduction of the vegetables remaining for the vegetables, it is advisable to use the horrors - in this case, you will not lose nutrients that stay in water and you will be eating later.
It would also be advisable to prepare, also to blame them.
The treatment is significantly enhanced by bioavailability of existing liquid composition in tomatoes.
For 30 minutes of tomatoes, the amount of liquid will increase by 25%.
The treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of betacombines, which can be found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, the horse, sweet potatoes and.
Oil and meat thermic treatment deprives the natural properties of existing proteins, making them easier to be removable.
Likewise, the processing of meat and egg thermic makes it easier to absorb existing iron and other minerals into an organism.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamins from 10% to 90%, to fibre freezing.
A combination of tomatoes with tomatoes can increase the Iron Curtain, which in turn ensures better brain and muscular activities.
Our body takes up to 33% less non-bloodic iron, which can be found in plant products such as dps, page green, cereal products, than bloodic iron that occurs in animal in products such as beef, fish and poultry.
You can significantly increase the absorbing of non-bloc iron in organism by using non-cardiovascular products containing non-blood iron products, together with vitamins, tomatoes, tomatoes, and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change non-bloc iron so that our organism is easier to absorb.
Iron is necessary for the production of chemoa, which provides oxygen in muscular and brain drain.
In order to maximise the benefits of salatoes, you add healthy fat, such as olive or linseed oil.
In preparation for butter read, add to vitamins and sardges of vitamins and red metigue, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin of D increases the amount of salt absorbed and plays an important role in the process of bargaining.
Auzas (as well as other adult products) together with Vitamin sources, such as strawberries, upwards, avenues and other fruits or coal, contribute to stabilising cholesterol levels, as also avoid an array of arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" has been criticised for the caricking of sealing.
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some comments claim that this is a racist insensitive.
With this slow effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change the reality of their reality in an absurd way and to play their identity.
You can turn yourself into ananals, dog or image that came into the Roja Lihštenstein glezna.
There are spray, imaging instruments that generate more than 30 million digitised selfia per day.
Any error shall become rapidly visible to the public.
Snapchat lenses have already been criticised in the past, with discards, that the app is to promote too black or gay skins like the ideal beauty benchmark.
The new lenses have been published this week, which allows users to build a seed, sounding dental and footwear, and some critics described it as racist cartoons - "yellow gemi."
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not show that companies have greater problems with diversity.
News and public neglect outbreak on Wednesday, when the Verge "The Verge" and "Motherboard" said that lenses have been taken out of the app.
The article explains that the lenses aim to portray Anime's fathers rather than to warn the people of origin.
However, people who have experienced racism have recalled painful stereotypes.
Other categorically denied similarity with the Anime.
In an e-mail newspaper Greissa Sparapani, an Italian artist of art students Greissa Sparapani has obtained a broad resonance in an E-mail letter, she indicates that the lenses were "insulting and intrusive." easy to say more. "
She added that it is difficult not to notice the similarities between asiate cartoons and lenses.
This shows that the lenses are not simply yellow, but the sellow face within the meaning of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
The American culture is also involved in an endless battle for diversity and inclusiveness from business meetings to Hollywood and the devices used daily.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different race, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create a picture that insults users, then 'no such things are left unnoticed', in the interview of 25 years old Keitija Žou.
On Thursday, the director of Medium product leader Jean ou survived his Snapchat app and recommended others to do likewise.
She explained in the "Medium" and telephone interview that she believed that the problems in connection with the race arises for Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Criticism was criticised by the leadership of the company, composed mainly of white men and then concluded its article with a reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so there are some other racial representatives working in the company, but they do not take office in order to be able to express their views safely and comfortably," he said. Jean LAMBERT (EPP-ED, FR)
They also agree with others, while Snapchat has not replied to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many people are represented by different race, indicating that this is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but the representative found that the company has a staff expert that will focus on the presence of racial minorities, which are not widely represented and will facilitate inclusion in the company.
At the same time, I am not going to renew my Snapchat account, adding: 'wonder whether they really need more users than we can understand that this is not right'.
The Congress of Congress declares that military officials had missed reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Court of Auditors states that the US Central Commonwealth Representatives have missed reports, picking war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than in fact.
Analysts of the central intelligence intelligence service show general dissatisfaction with the temporary report of the Group of the Cabinet Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Finance subcommittee's Republican representatives, indicating that their management control reports on the Americas The Spanish authorities in the fight against Islamic Valsts.
Central winning, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampe, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that the intelligence service reports approved by senior managers of the High-ranking Centcom reflect the US fight against terrorism than in fact, than in fact, Facts were regularly distorted, making better progress other intelligence service analyses.
California's Republican Representative Kens Kalverts tells us: 'Centcom actions are unacceptable: our soldiers are those who are suffering if our policymakers receive false reports'.
Centcom management errors in senior management of the organisation.
This 10 page report in detail reflects the existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central audience in Central America on the American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide uncompromising evidence that senior officials of Obama would have been distorted by reports, it shows that Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to show optimistic views the threat to the threat posed by Islamic State (known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report points out that, in the first half of 2015, the press release, statements and reports to Congress represent the situation considerably more positive than it was in fact.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the regeneration operation of Mosul could begin already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city of Iraq, which is still under the control of Islamic State.
Maximum Pompeo, the Republican Republican Party, said in his report: "A number of months of investigation clearly show it."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the headquarters of the US Central Administration have been represented by the central administration of Central America, reflecting the threat of ISIS in Iraq than was actually the case.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that the Islamic State is being distorted.
The report will be followed by new findings in this case on Thursday, following the report published on Thursday.
An investigation by the Ministry of Defence of the Ministry of Defence shall carry out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Committee for Intelligence Management, on Thursday, published their own report in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Task Force on the Republican Party.
In his report, the representative Adami Adams in his report, Centcom excessively restricted the preparation of reports by the intelligence services in connection with ISIS and Iraqi security forces by 2015.
Mr Schifa clarifies that this process' stopped spreading information ', worsened the ethics of analysts and' spreading false facts'.
But Shife and Democratic Party members added that there is no evidence that the White Nis has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports, in accordance with "previously defined or political position."
The Daily Beast on Thursday published the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress investigations.
The New York Times told the New York Times that the Pentagon General Inspection has opened inquiries following complaints from Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, lieutenant, said the Pentagon said that the Pentagon will not comment on the Congress report until the investigation continues.
He added that experts sometimes interpret complex data, and the Defence Ministry and the intelligence administration call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
Investigations are not just a question of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (statement expressed by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports made by the Central Authority on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reminds more than ten years of events, when Centcom intelligence analysts Gregorium Huskers made a study stating that George W. Bush The administration started the Afghan war, with too little thinking about its possible consequences.
Pekers played an important role in detecting Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hugera team revealed that, contrary to public reports, air strikes in the Islamic State's oil plants have not significantly deteriorated the financial situation of terrorist groups, because they were built have taken temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times in September reported that this discovery did not come outside the Central Management Board.
A moment ago, Centcom commandis General Loid Ostrict III, received sharp criticism, because many of the laws considered that the war reports describe the situation too positively.
In April, the General Ostrict leave and his seat came to the General Dos Wilzefs L. Votels.
In the US showcase in the field of women's field in the hocket, the US can win the fourth win in a row.
The day after victory over Japan with results 6: 1, on Thursday Keep the first two gateway in the US Lik Hockeja team, when the Americans carried out India's team with results 3: 0.
The awards in two games are not forward-looking, but 27 years old Bama said that you could not remember, or who had already succeeded in that.
She said: "I have no idea."
I am not from those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them no choice in their group with Britain, which, after victory over Japan, with the result 2: 0 remained unsuccessful.
Britain and the United States will meet Saturday to match the first round of the match.
The two teams have already qualified a quarter of a quarter, and the team will only be able to take the first place in the six team group and the second one.
The first prize winner will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch sample, which is the leader of the second group.
To avoid Saturday game, the Americans have already called astonishing storms, four years ago in London, in the last place between 12 teams.
It was also a team of Bama
She went in Bsbela, the field in the field in the room for his first time of 3 years old (her senior daughter had already worked on this type of sport in Drecsell) and national It joined when she was 16 years old, becoming random in the history of the youngest players.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because he did not get into the fun.
But 2012 was unfortunate for her and her team.
In the next year, an English team was appointed in Kregs Parhams and all changed to the good side.
Bama called it 'cultural, mentality and physical change'.
In London, we did not invest so much work as now.
We have changed everything.
At the weekend, Bama opened the result, with the gateway in the first half of the bargain from the distance of tuition.
India has started without victory in its accounts, but their output was very sluggish and sustained minimal results 0: 1 to the end of the third period when Bama repeated the gates.
She entered a bomb zone on the left side of the left, then it looked to the middle of the countryside and to send a bumbing into the opponents of the opponents in front of the Americans 2: 0.
In the fourth half of the period, the Melisa Gonzalesa won another gateway.
This was the first game of the US Guard in Bruges Dekuges, in each of the first three games being placed on the same gates.
She has been lucky.
And also Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Pashams, but how well it will show the game on Saturday.
The most pressing edition of the depression period is the 'Intelligent Malte'
In March 1933, shortly after the election to the President, the Frenchman Delano Rumel was sat in the ovation room to stop the edge.
President Rugfish herself tachored a fine culinary of a fine culinary, as a geese aker, or futile and Merilendas armurupuods.
On this day, however, his potato was far more modest: hot eggs in tomatoes, potato beet and desert - the potato fabric.
Dr Ziegelmane says: 'This is a way of showing solidarity in food production with people who have been very hard.'
Her husband, Mr Kou, added: "This is also the message to the Americans, as should be eaten."
A couple of Brooklyn Heights district is a day for historians.
In the last book of the last book, the Chinese virtual virtual kitchen in America, but Ziegelmane in its book "97 Skans" describes life through the Holy Hores in Manhetenas in the Eastern Lower East.
Their new joint work on the Intelligent Malte, published on Tuesday by the Charter of Harper, is a story of the American edition during the Great Depression.
By showing some solidarity in the culinary of culture, they entered the potato together reporters' Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop ', a simple lunch building on Flatirona Division and operate from 1929 when a major depression began.
Ms Ziegelmanme ordered a butter of butter and captured eggs, while 57 years old Kou ordered the web, potato frequent beet and vegetable salts.
When the reporter ordered fake green, a couple of them admitted that his choice is very relevant for the Great Depression Monitor.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said that the fake lake was very popular.
There was a laughed green, an activist lag and a bottle of the bottoms.
They were prepared on the basis of basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the edge.
The reason for this is how it is to be eaten so many villages, so that they are half a day instead.
Mr Kou asked.
"I'm sure that the winders are full of lead," he added.
In the predepression, the American lunch was cold by the Swedish gallery, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their male workers and brockets, lunch and dinner was accompanied by fresh bread.
In the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans the day, 'The Intelligent Maltech' described as the Americans were adapted to the circumstances where America suddenly no longer had refinement.
"At that time, the edience became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," Mr Kou said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on this subject.
The new budget was equally important: uncertain edience such as fake green and indignation became daily, indignation was "an excellent way to use surpluses," Ziegelmanes said. Because the gateway could conceal the unhesitant parts below the crushing mess.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that was a key component of American minds for years now became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of the diet were more important than long, new, unseen form.
In a long book, Mrs Ziegelmanes is a recipe for a recipe to prepare for the tiny walls of the butter.
Mr Kou added: 'It was not popular lunch table'.
Mrs Ziegelmanes emphasized: 'It was heartible'.
Low nut butter and cepts are not compatible.
Many of the problems of home litter were applied for difficult times.
Domestic economists such as LuCrisis Stenlia, Head of Economic Office of the Federal Household Economic Office from 1923 to 1943, imposed national eating habits, which was not seen before the Great Depression or after they were known.
In publishing articles and medical prescription newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become 'economists' and to adopt challenges such as converting the mackerel and literary micro micro to taste. net.
The Intelligent Maltite is a historic long history.
Especially interesting is the testimony of the government's attitude towards their hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Huder, "let me eat 'attitude'.
In fact he told him about his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, he was in fact building a fine million that he had become.
Mr Kou is telling him: 'He was a European virtual, for example, the tired measurement of cucumbers'.
He was eating almost a golden hospital, wearing lunch.
He was completely exciting from reality.
President Rugfish would have made the same mistake if his wife had not recommended him to set an example with their eating habits.
It was told that Rugfish is a domestic worker who did not learn to eat, so that the White Nams became the place, "where not only one of the most successful. The most unspirited edience in Washington, but also the worst edience."

In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tims Keins continue to set new standards of financial transparency," Clinton said in her statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind different prepagans and reservations, so that no promises should be made to reveal their tax information.
Publication of nominal tax information is a feature of the practice of the US presidential candidates, but it does not require the law.
In New York, Trump and his lawyers mention the audit of the National Revenue Service as a reason for undisclosed tax information.

Last week, Clinton was speaking during Omahus, Nebrask, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate, Bafets called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
The Bafets said that he is also carrying out the Revenue Service's audit and Trump is afraid of voters rather than the tax authorities.

Clinton live at the bottom of the Channel, in New York and for the period 2007-2013, has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40,5 percent.

Jewish film director criticises hotel Berlin on the removal of the Israeli telenegotiating code following an arsenba request - RT reports
The Jewish French film director saved a storm in social media, when it discovered that "Kempinski Bristol in Berlin is not available to Israel's long-standing code of conduct in Berlin. This is justified by the Arabic client requirement.
Klods Lancmans, documentary films about the Holocaust Holocaust Shoah director, did not hide their dissatisfaction with the hotel at Kempinski Bristol in Berlin and address an open letter to Germany newspapers FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find an Israeli telenegotiating code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries that can call directly from hotel number.
How is it possible that in Berlin, the new capital of Germany in 2016, Israel has slapped and destroyed?
Characteristics Lancmans
Instead, the Hotel of Kempinski Bristol offers a call to this country through the centre of call.
The jury requested an explanation from hotel staff.
Lancmans write that the answer was "shocked."
Hotel administrator explained that "it was deliberately aware of a hotel management decision."
The reason for taking the timber is even more sanctioned by film director film director.
"Most of Lithuanians are Arabs and they demanded the Israeli coding," Lancman quoted a hotel worker.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said that the Israeli Ambassador in Germany, Jakovs Had-Handelsman, called "a great shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
It is a great shame on itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, directly in this hotel network, is even more humiliated.
There is no need for clarification.
The man said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event received a rather broad resonance on the Internet, where people described it as a scandal.
Others believe that "the hotel of Kempinski was simply natural Arab clients.
One another said 'shame' said that the hotel is in the streets of the Kurfurendamm near synagogai.
Expenditure on Der Spiegel said that the hotel has quickly rejected all discards by stating that it was all "misunderstood" and apologise for Lancmanam.
"We have not received direct orders to withdraw Israel from the list of national numbering ', Sudan deutsche Zeitung cite a representative of the Kempinski.
And I note that the code is once again added to the list.
Police uses gumber lots and tear gas against protesters of Brazilian students.
Student and police clashes took place on Thursday in Sanpaulu, Brazil, where students gathered on the reform of government education systems.
Police used gumber lots and tear gas against students.
The problems started when the Ombudsman tried to erase students, as a result of the police used gumber lots and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in Demonstria to show their reluctance to reform education systems.
The proposal of the Governor's Governor Geraldo Alckmena is intended to close nearly 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators branded cheese with Ambassadors against the temporary president Maikla Temeru.

Scottish Kelity Skiners finishing the first to withdraw Britain in gold medals in gold medals
Sir of Scotland's first two cycling team in the Rio bicycle, the British team defended his championship last night. It won the London Games in 2012.
The 23 year-old athletes from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making a proud legitimate Scottish Seru Hola Hola and winning the favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an astonishing victory when Hogan fought the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it in the World Championship in London, even though Hogan had already finished a career in their sportsmen.
The problems were between Beijing and London Olympics because they had to replace the experience of the experienced start-ups of Dgeimia Stafu.
They were successful at the last minute.
When Hogan went out, his place was attempting to fill in Channel Emadi and Meta Krampton.
The British trainers put their hopes on the clock, seeing their potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenya - championship - four years ago with Hola and Skiners, who installed the record of the Olympic qualification, but told the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindes were close to the rain, the Kenry was nominated and the Scers were guardian of this leadership.
The change of the strategy played an important role in victory, because Hindes drive a greater carry-over to allow Kenya and, in particular, to drive faster.
Hospital was watching the BBC's spokesman and Sckeera, Kenya and Hindesa's eyes at the moment when they were embarking on the goat.
For 23 years, the glass of glaciers said: "It was an undefeated honour."
I do everything to defend my name.
In the Far we installed the Olympic Record and win World Championships.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After victory, together with Kenya and Holy in 2012, the London Olympic Games in London, Hindes found that deliberately fell on the trawl after the failed start.
Later he relied on his comment and the British competitors were unable to prove the opposite.
This time there was no incident.
Hindes said: "The British flags were remembered in the memory of London."
Over the last 3 months, we have become an island team.
We have lost so many of the world championships, so the victory of the Olympic Games was really special.
One medals a country that won seven out of ten gold medals in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, then five days will be very exciting.
In view of the outcome of Kenya, he really could repeat Hoja success by obtaining three gold parts of the Olympic gold.
Kenya would mean six gold gold and one silver medal, but Kenya has also been born on 23 March (looks like the British Sunday's date, because it has also been born in Stives) s, Mo Farah and Rodžers Banisters).
Hospital has also been born on this date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue on the next three days.
The 28 years old athlete from Boltton said: 'I simply enjoyed it all now.
The journey trip is always the best.
Because it can win together with teammates.
If honestly, then one is a little alone. "
Hindes said: "If he won another two gold medals, he would be appointed as a arm."
It was the only battle for medals on the day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlium Vigins, Eds Klensium, Stives Burks and Oveins Douls showed the fastest qualification for four kilometres in four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World ReCords, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and flict will take place today in the second half of today where the Vigin will certainly be at the heart of the focus.
Yesterday, before his qualification, he had disagreement with the commission when the judges were called him to measure his growth.
The Women's trip, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Jos Rovsela Šanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Archibalda, installed a new record time 4: 13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, ceroette, will win the middle of the medal in the middle of the Olympic Games.
In the face of the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements to be made at the Rio.
In the meantime, there have been different culturings in the fields of sectarianism and respect for dignity, with the resignation of the director, the director of the Sheet Satone, and the quarry is also closed by Holiton and Viktoria Bendleton.
But at the start of the first bicycle, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the beauland slaughterhouse is becoming uncertain because an ambitious treaty is interrupted.
Aluminium slaughterhouses and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear as its main customer has declared a interruption of cooperation.
This communication is based on the plans of the Government of Viktor Victorian to put an end to subsidising energy companies, which is vitally important in order to enable the company to continue its work.
The 20 years of subsidies will be interrupted in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 Alkoas Portlena factory posts are at risk.
The threat could be up to 2000 both direct and indirect jobs.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, since the battle is consumed by around 10 percent of all the electricity supply of the Viktoria.
In 2014, Alcoa was closed to the 'Point Henry' slaughterhouse, which led to a break in the operation of the Angleseas power plant.
Alcoas Portlena is working with losses and can be closed.
These events led to a number of years of speculation on the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of plant production.
The Latvian energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its "Loy Yang A power stations Latroubes in Latroubes, says that the other three owners are likely to cease their contracts.
Most power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the company's share in CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp Corp companies.
"AGL" looks forward to continuing the operation of the Portlena plant, which would mean a further energy supply battling or "said its representative.
"AGL" said that contracts are so-called "risk restrictive agreements" to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts are valid for 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL" intends to receive revenue from these contracts in 2017, "said company's representative.
Starting from 2018, the possible impact on profits is constrained by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
"AGL" states that losses of USD 187 million have already been calcured in their forecast, provided that these contracts will be terminated.
"Alcoa" says that the decision to terminate the Treaties will not affect the potential of "Alcoa" to continue to operate or supply energy to the slaughterhouse.
The US company tells us that in 2010 it concludes a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it will be suspended in November.
Analysts have expressed concern both about the possible closure of the Portlena Cup in Viktoria and the closure of Tomago factories near Newcastle, because of the weak economy of the sector.
"AGL" Executive Director Stneens Mikelson last week said that 600 megavatus spent 600 megavatus and Tomago 900 megavatus in Portland.
If both plants are to replace the energy market, then energy demand would fall significantly.
And that would not be good enough.
The Community legal centre shall reject 160 000 people each year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, while the budget could deteriorate.
Three out of five people in KWland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal disorder are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overstretched, warns that it will become worse for the sake of financing.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
The Director of the Legal Centre of KWWlena, James Fareim Farel, said that the latest report by the National Legal Centre of the National Centre for Legal Centres that legal aid has now been refused for thousands of people who need it.
Mistry Farels pointed out that if this decision is not lifted, the situation will only be worse.
He also says: "The legal centre of the KWland is chronically underfunded, this means that aid is being refused for thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debt, families who are going through divorce, workers who are dishonestly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary help.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding for 30 percent, this means that several thousand people in Kwland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General Prosecutor and Senator of Kwlenan Senator, George Brandis, immediately to halt the reduction of funding so that people who need legal aid can obtain it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of local communities and their clients and to the government of Palazčuka to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign is being brought to court as one of the workers discarded by a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organisers complained in court, because they did not act with information that the head of the North Carolina Operation Operator opened a firearm against someone who has travelled in one car in February. in the Member State concerned.
This incident was described in the court's claim, which was submitted to the Court of Auditors on Wednesday by the Gordini Bordini, a former campaigner of the campaign.

The head of the Philippines was disappointing the pistol, put his finger on the gauge and opened the glass against the Lower Movement, "Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that at home and regional campaigns management, Bordini learned that at least four people have experienced the same thing.
"Arms should not be sheltered to create losses," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the announcement was submitted, the Republican party nominee was a scandal in announcing people that "Second Amendment people," i.e. weapons owners and entreniasti, could act in the event of election he wrote his willary Hillary Clinton and his elected judges.
Trump's campaign announced that he had reprimed his words from the context, and he never has incited violence.
Bordini with its request seeks to recover compensation from campaigning organisers for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines - the attack, the misuse of the weapon and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's Houpa Hiksa did not make comments immediately.
There has been no contact with the Philippines.

A new tradition: pagazine and sports bleaches in the Chinese.
On Saturday, the first time in the Castle was pulled to pagazines and sporting holidays.
After 10 years of celebration, it was decided this time that Ezera Sunday will no longer be.
A new page has now been reallocated.
The day began with sporting competitions.
This time competitions were not conventional and too serious, because, for example, horrives were to be met in the guest target, boosted airport, with the man's hand, "bumbuying" There has been no single Olympic Games at all.
However, every participant could show how strong, courageous, successful and attacking him.
After sports games, all pulled free eating, where the scene started on Sunday.
A child's corner was also working for that time, where small cars could be used in the pockets and to obtain a new image in the floor in the floor.
The new one that could also become a tradition was a driving tool in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
Everyone spoke of the Inga Kadiķe-Skadjoy, head of the Body, who wished for a fine holiday and dry time, rains, but it was not much upset.
The fires continued with the younger population of the Chinese.
It is indeed good that the paste has been accompanied by five girls and one bottle.

Britain needs to hold the Olympic spirit and expand Hytrova.
Headtrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hyrope very attractive, just like in 2012, where we invested tremendous work so that all country regions would benefit from the Olympic Games.
The dispute and the Istal won a huge amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Hytrova.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to the unemployment of young people in Hytrova's surroundings.
As the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too high and that the extension of Chile is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain will never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it will be a global failure.
They were wrong for 2012 and they will not be right in the case of Chile.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hytrova has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Hile is a infrastructure project, which will benefit the whole society rather than individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth 211 billion, creating the soil both for employment and for expertise in this airport and throughout Britain.
A great team has been working in Hurtrova, which has created an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, including in time and in the budget from the terminal 5, which has been named as best airport terminal in the world five years from the ground. and finally, at terminals 2, built between two more intensive motorways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third score that will be funded with private investment of 16 billion munds.
The London Olympics 2012 were an excellent success, and I am sure that this will also be the case of Chile's expansion.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and extend Hile, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.

In Switzerland, a woman strikes on the great path in trying to commit suicide.
The ninth night leap on the road.
Police is trying to find witnesses in an accident when early on Thursday morning on a great road she went across several cars.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on A1, a town near Morges in Vo cantons.
The Vo cantona police report says that it was desperately wanting to commit suicide, the woman was in the dark dark, where he was travelling several cars.
Clearly, trying to kill yourself, the victims, 49 years old, saved several cars, including heavy machinery.
She died in the event.
A number of the drivers involved have already provided evidence, but others have not yet been clarified, says police, which calls for the involvement of the drivers and witnesses of the accident.
The case also has a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in such a case, which is a logical step, a politician Gilles Hofstellers said.
It is not yet known, however, whether anyone involved in the drivers involved will be penalised.
Was it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstellers added: "It will be a clear prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrians had gone on the road night, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that night midnight will be a pedestrians, a storing newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was justified in killing after his negligence when she passed a man in August 2014 in the night on the A1 road near Paijernes.
The Court found that 22 year-old victims were drunk and then nouted to sleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the police officer, which was on the way to the site, was in an appropriate manner and a judge admitted that the guest man was "completely unforeseeable and exceptional."
Anyone who has information on the incident near Morges on Thursday calls for contact with the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The Internet collects sign a new VID Manager for contest.
The launch of the "Avaaz.org" launched by the "Avaaz.org" started by a new Head of State for Public Accounting Service (Revenue Service).
The government, addressed to the National Alliance (N) and the Greens / Farmers (Greens / Farmers), points out that the public wants transparent and professional officials.
The petition was set up on 10 August and signed by 55 people at the moment.
The nomination process of the Director-General for the Directorate General of VID, Inga Kolegova, is a non-transparent and unprofessional process.
It reminds us of the best traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredited public administration and once again forces society to disappoint government and politicians.
"There is a need to compete with clear criteria against which all candidates are to be assessed," the petition text.
Mr Janis told the House that he had not known the criteria for the post chosen by Kolegova.
Nor is it clear what the candidate for the recruitment of the candidates is.
The petition points out that the National Chancellery should build a new, open competition, where professional candidates are actively addressed, attract personnel selection experts and offer appropriate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola formerly nominated Kolegova VID last week, but all parties voted against, but all parties voted against, and therefore the question of a week was postponed.

In three subgroups, Latvian athletes won one victory, but even two couples were even bigger.
The ratio of three couples of mutual small points, which were the most disadvantaged in this macophus loss, was precisely the product of Latvia.
"In the first face, we were in the lead, but from 16: 15 it remained on 16 points," Sir said.
Even I do not know how to stay without points in the remaining sixth part.
It must not play its part.
After that, the second sixth was on the order and in the face of the face was able to break the game, and it should have been a good one for the third six.
We started like this, but after we changed the parties, the result was only one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the package, all teams were similar, almost in all the mackets, with three faces, so the small points were important.
"It was better to play a more cold rather than a number of paragraphs 3-4 in turn," Dtists said.
We know that Evancane can be serned.
"In the first face, it was up with it, the second tranches 1-2 points, but the third + 4 already went to him," he said.
We tried to show the best game.
I've got to sleep, I don't.
The overall assessment situation before the consciousness was not looked at, but it was known that there were as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, it was bad," said Samoilovs.
From Evancane, a good server and in the first six were well coping with it, but the third open serve and it was difficult to create an attack.
On the other hand, I am quite mistaken directly at Pee serves, but this was to be done.
Samoilovs said that, contrary to the previous massacre today, sportsmen were not nervousness.
"We've played," she said, "We had to be better served," said sportspeople.
"They played well and at the end of the bottom-up."
Before the tournament has already said straight away, the lose is the least that could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even out of the groups.
"All of us waited the medals and we are also coming from the face, but then there is no difference: 25.Place or fourth," said Samoilovs, who predicted that dozens will continue to play together in the future.
I think that there will be no question and let us continue to play together, because this is just one stopper.
Samoilovam RioJaneiro was already in a career at the third Olympic Games since he was starved in Beijing in 2008, but was played in Beijing four years ago in the Malanland in London. I am Sorokina.
In the meantime, this was the second starts in the Olympics.
"Latvia energego" follows the process of opening up the gas market as well as the potential trading position of the trader.
The Latvian energy company "Latvia energego" follows the opening process of the gas market, both from the consumer and potential trader positions, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether the future of Latvia will join the gas market as a trader will determine what the gas market model and the legal framework will be created."
"That is why our side is actively involved in creating legislation and making comments, as well as presenting its proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and energy companies, "Latvian GGas" developed a draft of the Cabinet rules "Trade and use rules for natural gas trade and use" the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market, ensuring freedom of choice for natural gas traders from the natural gas users of 3 April 2017.
By working on the new market for natural gas, the aim of the EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and comprehensible to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user convenient service option chosen, "the trader's central model" where all activities relating to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one billing and one place of information provision and customer service; Allocation to the distribution system operator, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
Removing that a gradual opening up of the market for household customers, including by household customers, who do not wish to choose another natural gas trader, will be able to continue to obtain natural gas from the current trader on a regulated price, thus becoming associated users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas users to regulated prices is determined by the public trader," said the ministry.
In turn, economic operators will have to choose natural gas trader to conclude natural gas trade agreements.

"4.students" turned Dmitry Saidjasv, a neighbour, who has a neighbour to repair capital in his apartment and since then Dmitry from the Greeks drunk It is uncertain that there is a safe stay in live.
The problem is that my neighbours were subjected to arbitrary construction and have damaged the ceiling in my apartment.
Then I inform the Riga Construction Board, the House of Housing managers and other organisations.
The Management Board said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any expert.
"The owner of the home must be in the Latvian Inengineer Union and there will be a expert," Dmitry said.
Experts from the invited expert have been convened and acknowledged that the coverage was unsatisfactory.
However, since the first Dmitry construction board has passed a month and, until the beginning of this week, it was also unable to answer whether or not there is a danger to live in a living.
It is the law that has said - this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, writes for all in turn.
"Then I wrote Riga City, but they sent a house manager, then a house manager again to the construction board, and then there is an impasse," Dmitry said.
After all papers, it is clear that construction works have been stopped, something that can be heard at every time that someone works there.
In two months, there is a need to carry out expertise and during six months a owner who carries out repairs, all these defects should be prevented.
The independent expert has developed its opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
Experts have not indicated whether the metal complex of this unpromising structure is affected, so that there is no belief that the subcontractor of subcontracting is a threat.
"That is why we have requested additional clarification from this expert ', a representative of the Riga City Council, Ilze Žk.
Despite the ban on any repair work at the top of the upper apartment, it is becoming ever heard that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without construction permits is from 70 to 700 euros, but in a specific case the penalty can be much harder.
As long as the expert opinion is awaited, the construction board decided that both living blocks must not be operated - both in which construction works and the living of Dmitry living.
"This is the case in the construction board, which was not the case in which, in such a way, its own ignorance or simply reluctance, the population may pose a danger not only to its own property but also to the owner of the subcontractor, as a result of which the holder cannot operate his property" the representative of the building board of the building board.
Now Dmitry makes it possible to look for another place to live, to relatives, friends, hotel or to rent another living.
But the damage caused by Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbour's civil legal round, which can take very much time.
The arbitrary building on both residential families is now banned until the cvinengineer will produce its conclusion and may have to wait for even three weeks.
Creative losses will have to be borne by the owner of the survivors in which renovation has occurred.
The owner of this apartment because the construction board has not taken note of this is also threatened with prison sentences for a period of up to six months.
That's all right now.

NASA climate model: Venera ever sparsely populated planted
Based on NASA's latest climate models, the Venera has once been populated on the planet.
NASA GoBusiness Research Institute scientists have developed a model to explore Venera's history by means of tools and algorithms, which are also used by climate scientists.
Modelis was designed to determine whether the Venera, whose surface is a war where there is no water and where the atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, which has once been subordinated to earth.
Scientists have already said earlier that the speed of the Venera lnaver ceiling is attributable to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that the Venera has once been a plan, a very similar atmosphere and turned slowly.
Modelis also look at the former topography of Venera.
There have been more droughts on the planet than on earth, but they have had enough water and geographical diversity in order to be able to build life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early times of Venera, the sun was 30 per cent.
In simulation of the GISS model, the Venera Return model reveals that the gay part of the day on its long 2 months was explained by Mr Antonijs Del Genio, GISS scientist.
This process warns the planet's surface and causes a case which, in turn, consists of frequent layers of clouds who act as umbrella, protect the planet from the heat of the solar heat.
As a result, temperate climate temperature is emerging, which is actually some degree lower than temperatures on earth today.
Modelis illustrate the history of Venera, which is similar to the theory theory that scientists have developed in their hypothesis.
Although it was once inhabited, the Venera has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet stars over several billions of years.
The oceans of the oceans were hungry, and the garins were burnt by ultraviolet starters.
The Udenim completely evaporated across the palliations only the carbon dioxide atmosphere of the plan with deadly greenhouse gases - Venera, one we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venera climate model in magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patricile Roy resigned from "Avalanche" exercises in the training of "Avalanche"
On Thursday, the College of Avalanche coach and hokeja Operators, Patrician Roy, submitted a request, for reasons of insufficient impact in the team decision-making process.
Jo Sakiks said this message was confirmed by the College and said that the club will start to search for a new coach.
"In the last three years I have been vigorous, enthusiastic and determined to perform his duties as a key player in the Hocket and the Colombian club hocle," 50 years old Roy.
During this summer, I have had a lot of thought, how I could improve the team performance in order to give it the brand and to achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the vicepresident of the main trainers and the hokeja operations must be fully aligned with the organisation's vision.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning team performance.
At present, these conditions have not been met.
The week, which hired RoI on 23 May 2013, thank you for his contribution to the team.
It said that the Patriks was informed today about his decision.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him all the best in future.
In my first season with Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognised as a league for the best coaches and received a Dgeka Adamsa prize.
He helped the club to reach the 112 points and the first place in Central Division, but a Minesota Hokejists won the first round in the first round of the winning team. have not entered into play.

North Sea oil platforms renegotiate and strike stress
Workers' strikes on pay for the North Sea oil platform are postponed because the two sides of the dispute resumed negotiations, the leaders of the stories.
The Wood Group 'Wood Group' is taking strikes on the North Sea oil platforms in which Royal Dutch Sahell operates.
The joint statement says that Wood Group and Unite and RMT agreed to resume talks on resolving the dispute.
Over the next few weeks, a number of days of full days will start, starting at the beginning of next week, with a view to re-examining issues of concern.
The trade unions reported that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years, are against the planned wage reduction of 30 percent.
Due to pressure from the Wood Group this year, Wood Group cuts salaries in the North Sea for 9 percent.
Already in 2014 the company reduced salaries of land workers for 10 percent.
The article clarifies that additional salary cuts would allow companies to survive the market downturn.
In contrast, Sahell has already reduced salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to halt the operation of oil and natural gas in 10 countries to optimise their work in the run-up to large-scale mergers with the British Energy Companies Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Member of the Scottish Parliament met workers with representatives of workers to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea stress plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need a economy that benefits all rather than individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest nearly 1.4 billion dollars compared to 7 billion dollars invested over the last five years.
Keeping the pestars size at the speed of the pledge.
The latest Tolera Telephone mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of the pear return to the pledge.
The new data help tail astronomers to understand why the stars in this stars are coming to different speeds and the way in which the speed of the pestars is attributed to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of the stars, age and even its solar system, compared to our results, and even the history of its solar system," World Caltebras Mr van Rebula, a scientist of Infrastructure and Analytical Center.
The pledge is the 445 air years away from the earth.
Many stars in this stars are just starting to grow, reaching around 125 million years old.
They come back with a maximum speed.
When it comes to the maximum speed, this growing stars distributed a large amount of stars wind.
When they come to stars in the magnetic fields, they are stopping the stars.
Fresh stars ageing, the speed of their return is falling.
The Keyers is measured by the speed of each star, setting time between the appearance of the identifiable stars, such as solar planes.
The latest catalogue of the stars shows that more stars are slower than smaller stars.
The ball is comparing the stars with debelts, higher growth deters make pirates cheaper than small fertility deters.
It is true that the Pledge is expected to be "white" shows that slowly rotating sites are larger and massively, while the sooner sites are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Pledge is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where the characteristics of the stars can be compared with the speed of the ceiling.
The House will also vote on a resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
We still have much to learn how, and why and why slow down the speed of the stars and for their complete entry into the process.
In detail, and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the return rate in three new publications, which will shortly be published in Astronomy Journalism.
