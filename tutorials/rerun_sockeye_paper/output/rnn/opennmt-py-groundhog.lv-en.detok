New doctors: calls for new protests
The new doctors are calling for their trade union to be open to protests in the dispute over the new Treaty.
A British Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to demand the Council to support the broader protests of September in September.
The UK has failed to address the doubts about the treaty.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected LMA.
The Treaty voted in favour of 58% of all members involved in the vote.
On Thursday evening, the report published on Twitter, a member of the UK Council, Elna has said that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and that the contract supply has been rejected.
She said that the UK vote in the UK's vote was fully rejected and decided to request new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues. "
In response to the silence of governments, the UK is officially requested to meet the LMA Council today in order to authors new contracts in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors have participated in the six strikes, including in the history of NHS's history.
After the vote, which rejected the contractual conditions proposed by the LMA, the representative of the LMA, the representative of the new doctors, of the new doctors in LMA, will be resigned.

Russia and Turkey
This is the case.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday in order to make the most of the economic and economic sanctions.
However, in the first place with the Turkish leaders, the Vladimir
However, the two rounds.
The hardship of the Putina examined the cloud of clothes and caused the warm emotions, even in the light of his usual abstained.
On the other hand, the Putting of an Erdogan Erdogan called a 'dear friend' for at least five times as his' dear friends'.
I felt a number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only be improved to pre-crisis levels, but it will become even stronger.
A newspaper reported that Erdogan was be. "
I think his enthusiasm leads to the controversial sense.
However, Putting radiation from Putin shows that the Russian leadership has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the crashing of Russian aircraft to the Syrian border.
At the time, Moscow reacted strongly.
Putin accused Ankara that it has taken its inverse.
The case was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
It is a very difficult Reconfidence, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, the Russian public position has changed.
For a number of months, governments controlled by the governments of the government have been aggressive accusations against Ankara.
There was a lot of the Turks, the Turks.
The most serious accusations that the Erdogan's family has made a profit from illegal oil trade under the control of the Syrian government.
He is, of course, denying that.
However, the main message of St Petersburg is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin was apologised for President Erdogan.
Russia could be seen as a kind of victory.
The benefit of the peace reconciliation reconciliation is obvious.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all friends in the failed coup last month, with their attempt to overthrow.
The number of terrorist attacks has been shaken by his position too.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have led to fundamental losses, especially in the arterterres of the arteries, which generally provide for the inflows of millions of Russian tourist destinations in Turkey every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
There is also an appeal in the Russian Federation, in the Russian Federation and for the EU, when regular flights are restored.
They are looking for a period of maternity leave in the Mediterranean.
This week, the national TV and vegetable imports of fruit and vegetables will be reduced as a result of the reintroduction of Turkey's fruit and vegetables.
As to quote the local newspaper Vedemosti: "the room for them, tomatoes, tomatoes."
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is a dusk to the West for the West.
There can also be dissatisfaction at all of the long-standing negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin's intervention, which is very happy to use the situation, that Turkey alienated from the West.
The Russian leader has no doubt on the Ankara activist.
take account of the fact that Moscow understands it well because of the deeply rooted fear of the regime.
The summit that took place in this Chamber, which took place in this Chamber, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to presented an analyst, marginalised alliance, two countries that feel marginalised from the West.
However, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia is presenting itself as a means of peace, but in fact, Russia and Turkey support the illegal side.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two Presidents announced that they were not discussing this issue at a press conference in the press conference.
The President of the European Parliament, Mr Putin, said that "it is up to the President of the European Commission to ensure that there is no agreement on the matter."
There is no clear consensus among the two countries to find common languages on the Syrian side.
However, after months of publicly hatred, hate relations and potential disasters when a member of NATO is a member of the Russian Battlegroups, the situation has improved, as the two leaders at least have resumed the negotiations.

Is it the outcome of the fight for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that was considered to be possible for the President of the Commission, which was considered to be possible President of the Russian environmental policy, is to be seen with great scepticism.
At the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, 'it is a fact that I ask you to give me this difficult job in early 2012, even to say that I would ask that, in the beginning of 2012, I would

The head of the first Latvian state, but the first president of Latvia, is the last of the first Latvian President to have the last year of his first Latvian presidential term.
Nobody is so very much in favour of democracy and the rule of law as the head of the country, the Gustavans, a decade ago, writes out the Arnolds of the Arnolds.

Today's politicians are poorly know the history, they referred to the Klea Ulster, the leader, but rarely who know what he was.
The only person who he did not have any flax has been General Balodis.
Even if he is lagging behind and smarter, he was hysterical.

Agree.
When we adults, we are anxious, alarmed - generally we know what is happening and how to deal with it.
We can make our anger and nice at the sevorage: to be suppressed, hide, hide, to tell us their friends or others, we can be anchored in their friends or others.
We are not against the others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are looking for anger, do not understand what is happening with them as they call them and how they live.
They can say: "I'll leave it!"
Children are living in the carpet, they are entirely here at this point, they are spontaneous at this point, they have a spontaneous and truly sensitive exercise, and are often also in emotions.
It is very important that the parents of the parents do not ban the feeble, including anger, of the anger, and they do not, but the opposite, but the contrary would help a child.

It is the fact that I have been every detail in detail, which the second is doing and that it is starting to fall into it.
People are starting to go to each other, especially when it is not even about what we have done on the day.
My personal experience is to think about this, which is why I have not withheld relations over a few months.

German researchers discussed the number of "Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the number of fatalities in the former border in East Germany would be much higher than was considered in advance, but doubts about the actual number of victims still have not been dispersed.
According to the data made available by the Berlin Wall, the Berlin Wall Checkpoint, at the border with the Western allies, in the border with the Western allies in the border with the Western allies and the subsequent West
The semi-border deaths in border related deaths have been investigated for years and remedial.
11 deaths, including the victims, are added to the list this year, including a six years old boys on the part of an old boy, a family trying to reach the West, through the then Chechosloc.
There is also a demarcation among the new Berlin Wall.
"The amount that was caused by double communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," he said.
"Our task is to ensure that the caps of people who died in an effort to escape from the Communist state are all the same," he said. "
But other researchers have already been called into question.
"The figure 1841 is not a convincing ',, in an interval, the Süddeutsche Zeitung claims in the Berlin Free University of East Germany.
He, together with other researchers, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths on the border, and they have been able to approve only 260 cases.
In the past, the researchers have been slow in 2009, that only the communists have murdered 138 people.
In the light of the people who have died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to become the West through neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach around a thousand victims.
However, this is much less than 1841.
The methodology for the number of victims could be in different ways.
Checkpoint was also a suicide number of suicide border guards in East Germany, regardless of whether they were directly linked to their service.
The semi-fatalities that are not linked to direct violence.
"If the ancient age of 70 between 70 and 80 years after the discovery with border controls died, it should be the murder of this murder."
However, this House is convinced that a distinction should be made between the old people, who may have died as a result of the handling of their experience, and those who have caused the death of a long-awaited hot at the border.
Regardless of the list of victims, it is not easy, because the Communist East German authorities have not accumulated such statistics, and for researchers to be given the documents of the various archives in a number of national archives points.
However, it has recently announced new documents and could therefore come forward with an estimate of the number of victims in the near future.

In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit in the budget constitutes a threat to the creation of a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) came up with an opinion that Spain and Portugal have failed to implement enough measures to reduce the deficit to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the 3%.
It is estimated that, despite the austerity measures implemented in Portugal at the end of last year, the Portuguese budget was at 4..
However, the European Commission decided not to apply both countries in economic sanctions, while at the same time establishing fiscal targets for the nearest period.
One of the reasons why the EC does not introduce sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
The additional sanctions for such negative sentiments would only be increased.
itisation that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, from the start of its decisions on common rules and then not being able to apply them in practice.
For example, the German Bundesbank President Jenss has indicated that Europe's rules are rerecommendations to itself, creating a perception of the EU's rules, and not binding.
Now, the EC proposed and all the Member States have approved the deadline for the adoption of the deficit in the budget for Portugal by the end of this year, for Portugal and by 2018.
The European Commission promise to examine the progress made in the coming months, while at the same time indicating that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances are required.
The initial forecast shows that Portugal's objective could be achieved to reach the deadline and the budget deficit could be reduced to 2...
This means that, under the Stability Programme, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures at 0..
These measures should be included in the budget of this year's budget, with a focus on the procurement of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complicated in the case.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4...
Furthermore, the consolidation measures should be 0. 5% of GDP annually in the next two years.
In particular, the achievement of these objectives is the fact that the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the creation of eight months for the creation of a government, and an increasing opportunity for Spain to have an early parliamentary elections in a year.
However, the polls polls show that third countries also have a significant change in the country.
The most popular party is still in the current prime minister, which would once again have 33% of votes.
There has only been a slight increase in the socialists, while in the spirit of austerity measures, the 'Podemos' party, or 'Total' in the 'Total'. "
The People's Party wants the socialist and 'Ciudadanos' involvement in government this month, otherwise it will not go to mid-October and submit to the European Commission for approval for the 2017 draft budget.
As stated by the European Parliament, the representative of the Parliament's Parliamentary Committee on the Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, said that Spain will become all the more European.
It is a critical pity in the Gulf of Riga.
Fifth years after the beaches, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste is growing every year, and there is a large number of bathing sites.
It is RRiga's Riga.
In the final case, there is a clear need for the creation of bathing sites to be used on a daily basis, but to fight against unclean visitors.
In addition, waste from rainy water can be washed into water during the rainy period, thus much damage to its quality.
With the exception of Spain, the plight of the beaches and Kurdish on Kurdish, plunge to Latvia is critical.
This week's campaign has been launched by volunteers volunteer.
For the fifth year of the Riga Sea Gulf of Riga, the activists have concluded that the number of waste left out of the population of the population has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has joined.
"We see that this will be a year when the number of waste per 100 metres 100 metres is probably even more than 200 units', says the report, JECis 17.

There is also a bathing area in Riga.
For example, almost 800 waste units that are critical to hundred metres, are critical.
In the campaign, the campaign also makes it clear that I would also like to look at smoothly and not all the warning signs or the ban.
"The average figures for all the three sites in Riga, together with Daugavjoint, Yemeni and the old age, have unfortunately been sanctioned and far more than the desired objective, which is to reduce the number of waste
In the next few days, the last day of the summer, the summer of the summer, the summer of the summer, the summer, the spokesman said the spokesman for the first time.
However, the fight against clean visitors is very difficult.
We come back to the cultural issue.
"Those who have to use alcohol are using alcohol, smoking and do all the things that must not, even special signs," say MEPs.
It therefore calls on the bathing visitors to report on polluters to the police.
The police can be called a police, secure point on these offences and in such a way all fight.
Perhaps it may be a case of new alerts, but, as I said, it is unlikely as a radical change.
"As all, together, we need to approach and be tolerant," he said.

The future of Port of Portland is becoming clear, since an ambitious contract is interrupted.
Aluminium, the future of Aluminium and hundreds of staff of its staff in Port of Portland has become uncertain, as they have announced the interruption of energy companies.
This communication is based on the plans of the government of Europe to put an end to the subsidisation of energy companies, which is vital to enable the company to continue to work.
20 years of subsidies will be suspended in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 Alcohol Portland is at risk.
The threat could be up to 2000 both directly and indirectly.
In addition, it will also be unpredictable, since there is an estimated 10 per cent of the electricity supply from all sources of electricity.
In 2014, in Alcoa, the Alcoa, which led to the operations of the leftist power station, which led to the break of Anglean power station.
Portland in Portland is working with damages and can be closed.
These events were caused by a number of years of speculation on the values of Australia and the cost of the factories.
A "AGL" of the energy supplier, supplied to the power station in Latin-Yang IeleYes Ieleyes, says that the other three owners will not stop their contracts.
The majority of power stations include Aluma and Alumia, in addition to the company's share of the "CITIC CorTIC" and Japan "Marubeni Corp."
"The AGL is looking forward to the continuation of the Portlene plant, which would mean further energy supply, which would mean further energy supply."
"AGL" said the contracts are called "risk restrictive contracts," which would enter into force in November 2016.
The Treaties have a period of 12 months and will therefore apply until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts in 2017," she said.
From 2018 2018, the potential impact on the profit of profit by the market is limited to the benefit of a favourable market forecast for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL states that in their own forecast, the loss of dollar dollars has already been considered to be interrupted.

As from June next year, these legal centres will receive a 30% less funding than to date.

This decision would only become necessary if the decision is not to be lifted.
He also says: "The legal centre of the Kwines is all underfinanced, it means that the aid is refused thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end the violent relationship, people with deep debt, families who are experiencing divorce, workers, who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive assistance.
The federal government in June 2017 will reduce funding for 30 percent, meaning a number of thousands of Kwines's population will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the public prosecutor and the Kwines to immediately stop the reduction in funding, to immediately stop people in need of legal assistance.
Last year, the government found its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the national level.
Now the time has come to draw attention to the needs and the needs of local communities and their clients to invest in this important area.

It will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my view, makes the Heathrow of the Hemicycle in the same way as in 2012, where we invest a huge amount of work for all the regions of the country.
There was an extremely large number of the from the Olympic Games.
And we will do this once again, by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near the Habitats.
We local communities alone will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to the unemployment of young people in the Hemicycle.
As for the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that the extension of the Hemicycle is too ambitious.
At the time, the people said that Britain will never be prepared to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it will be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong for 2012 and also in the case of HChControl.
There are always barriers that need to be overcome, but they have been overcome to date.
As the Olympic Games, the Hemicycle is an infrastructure project of which the whole society will benefit, rather than individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating soil and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
It is a great team for a great team that has caused the investment of 11 billion pounds into the infrastructure of the 11 billion pound into the budget and the budget from terminal 5, which was called the best airport in the world for five years

Energy companies are under pressure from the price of oil, and the situation is more complicated by the decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, in Scotland, the Member of Parliament met with representatives of the workers in order to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strikes plans.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole require the economy to benefit from all, rather than individual individuals.
In 2016, nearly 1.4 billion dollars are expected to invest in projects in the North Sea, compared to USD 7 billion in the last five years.
He's a verdict of the size of the
The latest King's mission has helped astronomers for the best catalogues of the stark catalogues of the stark catalogues.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the stars of the stars are in the different speed, as well as the way in which the return speed is to apply to the development of the planet.
"We hope that in comparison with other start-ups, we will get more information about the relationship between the stars, age and even the solar system," it said in a statement on the history of the world Caltech infrastructure.
There is a 445 million start-ups on the ground.
A number of stars in this starch only start to grow to approximately 125 million years age.
They return to a maximum speed.
As a result of the maximum speed, the growing stars of a growing stark wind is a large amount of wind.
For the stark stars, they are the star of the stars.
Far from ageing, the speed of their return is reduced.
Keeping the stars on each of the stars on the stars, with the time between the
The new start-ups of the new stark catalogues show that there is a slower increase in the number of stars than the stars.
Rebulent stars compared with debelitants, more debelitants than small dejob-sdecepts
It is a very little stark, but it is a very little stark, but it is a very little stark.
Thanks to the creation of a change on the ground, it is a great space for space to be a great space of space, which can be compared with the sun's characteristics.
It is the only way to make it possible for both parents to do so, and that the new start-ups of the European Union will help to create a more theoretical models.
We still have much to learn how, when and why are slowing down the stark speed, it is a lot to learn about this.
Rebull and his colleagues were presented with a set of "an analysis" of three new publications, which will soon be published in Abromy.
