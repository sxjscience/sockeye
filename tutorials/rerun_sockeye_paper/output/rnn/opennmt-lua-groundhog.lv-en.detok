New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The new external representatives call for the opening of the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to request the Council to support more extensive protests in early September.
JAK believes that the ministers have failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected LMA.
58% of all members who participated in the vote.
On Thursday morning, British Conservative MEP Caroline Lucas told the hearing that "the government continues to be silent on this matter, and that is why the government's proposal is not the case.
She said: "In light of this, the offer of the JAK has resulted in a completely rejection of the agreement and the decision to require new formal negotiations to discuss key issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today officially requested a meeting with LMA, with a view to the development of new treaties that would enter into force in September.
The new doctor has taken part in six strikes, including the first time in the history of NHS.
Following the vote, which was rejected in LMA, the new doctor resigned in BMA, a new doctor by Dr. Johanlan Malawana.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he was told BMA members that the offer is good and will be adopted.
After the vote, Mr Dakrawness Hants said that the contract will be concluded with England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance that is excluded?
The following spoke:
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to bring them to the end of the eighth month and announced eight months of war.
However, Vladimir Putin welcomes the fact that the Turkish leader in St Petersburg has the impression that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However, both rounds.
Vladimir Putin smiled and did not provoke emotion, even in the light of his commonality, even in the light of his commonality.
On the other hand, the Recep Tayyip Erdogan was at least five times as a "dear friend" of his "dear friend", he said.
I feel that number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve the level of pre-crisis, but it will be more important than ever.
For the next day, a newspaper said that Erdogan was not the case.
I think his enthusiasm gives rise to a controversial feeling.
However, from Putin's point of view, it has not been forgotten that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the shooting at the Syrian border on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow responded sharply.
Putin accused Anwar of the Anwar in the war.
The rest was more painful, given that it came from friends.
Restoring real credibility will be very difficult.
Since November, the public's public position has changed.
For several months, the controlled television has spread aggression against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed to be the fault of the Turks.
The most serious accusations were made that the Erdogan has made a profit from the sale of illegal oil to the Syrian side.
He was, of course, denied this.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could take it as a kind of victory.
The winning benefits from the peace reconciliation are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all our friends after the unfortunate coup d'état last month in which he tried to gas.
The numerous terrorist attacks have shocked his position.
There are also economic reasons.
Russia's sanctions have created severe losses, particularly the prohibition of charters, which normally provide a number of Russian tourists in Turkish prisons.
The number of tourism has dropped by almost 90%.
Also, the Russian people and the charters are being facilitated by the Russian army and the charter.
They look forward to the in the Mediterranean in the middle of the season.
This week, the country's TV provides for the fall in fruit and vegetable prices, because imports of fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As a Local newspaper, the Duristors, tomato,.
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara has been angry to the West, in their view, in their view, the weak response to the attempted coup.
You can also see disagreement with the prolonged negotiations on the accession of the EU and Putin, who are happy to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has made from the West.
In the case of Russia's leaders, the leaders of the political groups will have no hesitantly to support their elected government after a coup d'état.
Please note that Moscow understands this well, because it is deeply rooted in the fear of a regime in the regime.
The summit, which took place in this luxous connotations, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as a matter of routine, an alliance that is excluded from the West.
However, in spite of the public demonstrated, there are still considerable differences of opinion between both countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia is presenting itself as a peace carrier but, in fact, Russia and Turkey in the opposite direction.
After more than three hours' long 'negotiations, without wanting to discover the information, the two presidents of the press announced that they had not been discussed.
The President of the Turkish Republic was determined to shirk the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wished to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, months later, holy hhoed relations and potential disasters, when a member of NATO was absent, has improved, since the two leaders at least have resumed negotiations.

It has abandoned these ambitions, since eight years ago, the bank was almost bankrupt and needs financial assistance.
In the meantime, brands have been used by experts' brands to protect other consumers' brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sport sponsors, starting with the Siberian Archbishop Champion.
However, it has now been decided to put forward other national brands.
Scottish Royal Banaka will be open to Scottish clients but will not be stigmatised.
In England and Wales, all the ICB references, outside the headquarters and official exchanges, will be replaced by NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland already being used bricks in the Republic of Ireland.
There will now be a lower private financial bribery, such as Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holland.
Feasibility has been interviewed during the course of the trip with clients and staff from InvernesIreland.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: 'The SKB will become a brand of our investors' brands, since we are now becoming more brands on brands. "
The Bank itself became a global brand and the SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we are no longer a global ambition, we have domestic ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in my own sector and our staff will be working with the brands under these brands.
The ICB has already announced that the "Six Union" will not continue to be sponsoring the various brands.
"It is time for a brand bank to become a brand bank because we have asked ourselves to be a better bank for our clients?"
Three years ago it would have been very cynical, if we declare that we will become a great bank to our clients and develop these brands.
However, we have clearly achieved a great deal of change, however, with a focus on the needs of the clients rather than our own needs, but we have clearly made a major difference.
We can revitalise these brands again, so I think that now is the right time.

The detors of the Archbishop shall be remembered for the first time twice in the finest photographer.

He is a spiritual and powerful, but his tactical of his tactics separated from other fences.
He is a fantastic player, his enthusiasm and harbours for years.
A few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, I said to the INTA Committee that he would have fought to win 6 000 victory without only weekly at the weekend and in the big race.
However, it is a real pleasure that the Cold War has been regularly observed in the United Kingdom.
He is a life of great magnitude, which is proving perfectly to the British race.
The European Parliament noted this achievement by its firm position, with its firm endorsements.
From finalizing the finishing line to a flight, the French authorities have for twenty years now the horse.
This has been the adventure of admiration.
He has been winning many of the races, including the famous 1996 "Askota," in Askota, who has suffered an accident and a disqualification on the use of preparations.
Three years ago he was unable to return to the disqualification from a six-month period, but he demonstrated its strength by the strength of those who questioned him when he returned to his best form.
And he could take part in the course of the past for some time - Dessors have previously said that they would be willing to continue their participation in at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin dismissed Mr Putin's Chief Executive Offico@@
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpected to dismiss the President of the Administration of Sergei Ivanova.
Ivanov has been born for many years Putin's closest.
Today, the Institute has been appointed a special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin's statement says that Putin's intention to release Ivanov from the President of the Russian Government was "not to give any reason."
I was appointed to appoint a Paul Vaino, who was a Vice-President since 2012.
For the 44 years it has been the diplomat.
They were born in 1972 in Tallinn in 1972 in Tallinn, a prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Embassy.
As the Kremlin homepage, the President of the Kremlin and the Government of Belarus, were the President of the European Council.
He said, "I am sure," he said, "I am in favour of your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work in the country's President, when designing laws and controls.
Putin told the Russian television station that Ivanov himself had liked to leave the post and he was a substitute for his job.
Are the smiles convincing?
This step confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a sene and close to Vladimir Putin's ally and, like Putin, who worked at the Soviet security service in the Soviet security service.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
During the parliamentary television station, the two men declared that Ivanov resigned from his own initiative.
But nowadays, it is rarely seen as a clear explanation of this, particularly in the case of the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the fight for power?
No one knows this.
However, the official statement that was seen as a potential President, suddenly, would have liked to become the leader of Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website is to give Putin a chance: "It is a fact that I am asking you to entrust this difficult job in early 2012."
It appears that I have been working for four years and eight months.
Ivanov has entered in December 2011.
He was Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former KGB, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, Ivanov, Ivanov.
When Putin came to power, he referred the Ivanov to five people who were most trusted.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was seen as a potential candidate for the Russian presidential candidate, since the rest of the term would be unconstitutional.
However, at the time of the President, the President became another Bridge - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, and three and a half years ago.

The engineers have connecting the northern part of the KWD and vibrating, which means that the bridge is now connected with the Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the construction of a bridge is coming to an end.
The structure of the bridge building is of 600 metres long and weighed 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of the concrete and 46 support cable.
Today's 1.35 billion pound projects will be completed in May 2017.
The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Mr Keuns, has travelled to the construction site today and was one of the first sticking points.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment."
In this project, we are seeing an unparalleled civil engineering solution, with more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Regardless of the immense size of the bridge weight and the size of the bridge, it is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Altogether, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the final phase, which will connect the bridge with Rositu, which means that all the bridges are ready for entry.
director of the Fourth bridge connection, Michael Cashman (S & D): "First connection is a very important point."
In this fantastic project, the first link is demonstrated by the first-class project.
Following the final stage of the installation and its connection with the north tower, we were to connect the northern road sections with the land part or vibrant.
It has been done by giving the Northern Ireland access to the 700 milk-meters in the south.

She has not lost many of the struggles since the summer and winning a series of wars for the long term.
In the light of the two rounds of two rounds of rotation, it was an illusion.
In the same vein, the share of the weights and the free movement, where the Bailt will defend the title of his championship, is still before.

I am calling it a year of the Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
First of all, I have been at the forefront of the Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three of the light points, Simone Bailsa, Gabija Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, who inspire many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that they are part of the team, including the Jewish Raismane, which is a Catholic and Mediscon Kociana, which is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly representative America.
It has also strengthened the participation of Latin American athletes in this area.
In the last four years, the best exercise is the Americans' origin.
Last year, Simone and Gabon took place in 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Dugread became the Olympic chamber, the Olympic chamber became the Olympic chamber.

In fact, exercise is a costly exercise in sport.
Most of them are in urban areas, which can afford this sport.
In these clubs all their trainers, and this is a costly and a long contribution to the euro area.
Eimia Burricky, Vice President of the Basin Hernanopata, has been trainned on the trainings.
We must ensure young girls who inspire Simone, Gabija and Laurija, cheaper exercise exercises.
I have established my own small organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is in Heathrow, and we are offering more than 15 000 cities for young people (mainly the black and Spanish) exercise, and we have also trainned with national and international champions.
In September, we will open up a branch in Detroit in Detroit (in my home town), to provide local young people with the opportunity to familiarise themselves with this excellent form of sport.

This combination provides a long life with good health and success, both in school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train and have been fantastic.
It is very important to take this form of sport, especially young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
I would like to thank Simone, Alija, and Medisha on the excellent "Map showing that the gold medallists" of the Olympic gold medal and motivating numerous young girls from different backgrounds to become
Following the rejection of the Return Directive, the new doctors intend to go further.
Ministers were hopeful to put an end to the disagreement in the agreement with the British Medical Association.
In July, the Hants declared plans to conclude the contract, stating that the NHS is in a precarious position and will only be detrimental to workers and patients.
The first new outlines have already been signed by the new out-of-date treaty, which will require changes to the conditions of night work and weekly in order to improve working conditions.
Last night, Dr OMA, the new doctor spokeswoman Dr. Eslow McCanta announced that the new doctors are still serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, notably that it will deepen the labour crisis and this does not create any level
Eight weeks later, when the first new doctor will sign the new treaty, the new treaty will make progress, because there is no time left.
BMA's efforts to solve the problem are faced by the government's reluctance to engage and sometimes with full silence.
This has happened despite the fact that, last month, Dolrear Hants said that his doors were always open.
The Commission should take immediate action to stop it, stop inaction and engage with new doctors.
If he does not do so, young doctors are ready for new protests.
At the end of April, more than 13 000 rhetoric operations were suspended at the end of April, while the nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who were in a spiked.

The culture of political correctness
In accordance with the management report, the former Yugoslav mayor Rahman Rhine was dismissed from the post of corruption.
The government's report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to the whole of the Muslim communities.
The former Prime Minister, Sir Eriks, will be critical of the police, the election observation and the city council, that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "fear of ethnic and religious interests."
The former Secretary of State, who has now become an anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy seconds from the elections to the ballot box.
He also recommends that the electorate should show the identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters must be given the name and address.
He even recommends to mark the end of the votes cast by voting in favour of the final vote.
Whistleblowers must also have greater protection, says Sir.
He believes that greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups should be ensured.
He says: "The intention is not only to prevent fraud, but also to protect local communities from corruption and fraud.
The report was commissioned in Dauningstrt after a scandal in relation to the city's elections.
Last year the Special Electoral Court ordered the annulment of the mayor of the city of Lutfuru from the city of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahho 'cynically obstructed the religious vision of his Muslim community, which was accused of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahmans led my election campaign," said Mr Rahman.
About 300 votes were counterfeit or doubtful, because one person has been voting on several occasions.
Sir Eriks Eriks, President of the Republic of Bulgaria
He pointed out that fraud could be particularly worrying if the older members of Muslim communities forced to vote for themselves.
On the other hand, it has been suggested that a number of measures have been taken to improve the quality of the electoral system, including the identification of identity document.
His report tells us: 'Evidence shows that vulnerable ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote on the oldest candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan. "
"There is a fear that the areas of political correctness are not focusing on these problems because of their ethnical and religious interests."
Sir Jonathan Sacks
The report examining the effects of the propensity of the site shall also be invited to carry out a more thorough registration, in order to prevent the use of the list of voter lists in the area of immigration and benefits.

German Researchers are debating the number of victims.
According to the new research fatalities by the Communist yoke, the number of former former former Eastern German vouchers could be much higher than in the past, but doubts about the true number of victims still remain unanswered.
According to the data that the Berlin Wall museum museum museum muzzle, from 1945 to 1989, and the Communist authorities in western western wall murdered, the Communist authorities were murdered by the Communist
Museum with border deaths has been reconsidered for years and every time to correct the number of victims.
A further 11 deaths will be added this year, including among the victims of a six-year-old boy, who drowned the family in the West trying to live in the West via the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet army deserts.
"The amount of damage caused by the double communism and socialism is not yet fully documented."
"Our task is to ensure that the capes of the people who died, try to escape from the communist controlled state of the Communist country.
However, other researchers have already been questioned.
"The Image 1841 is unconvincing."
He, together with other senior researchers, is currently reviewing the alleged death toll at the border, and so far they have only 260 cases to date.
Previously, researchers were slow to kill 138 people.
In view of the people who have died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to come into the West via neighbouring countries, the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the differences in the number of victims could be the different methodologies.

Regardless of the accounting of the victims, it is not easy, since the Communist authorities of the Communist East of East Germany have failed to store these statistics, and the researchers must take the form of documents in different archives.
However, the group has recently recently backed new documents, and so it might come up with a new number of victims.
LPF President Pone for Rio + 3
In the last few days, the President of Latvia Valdis Zatlers will address the House in a formal sitting.

At the request of the federal authorities, Usja coach took her to help her.
Pone, which is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, criticized the LOK's activities, leading to the awarding of the Olympic Truce.
In my view, it is unethical in the Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to hold one of them.
"I don't know why the PBD was not the case," Pone said, "I don't know how the federalists are not being valued.
In the same vein, Mr Jakubovsky said that he had received a complaint before the London Olympics and called for Latvia to not send any thoughts to the International Water Sports Agency.

The prefect office indicated that these self-sufficiency needs to be dismantled, since they create a shadow economy and do not pay taxes and sanitary risks.
The humanitarian court has explained that these small enterprises are essential, because the food provided by the government and the support group provided by the government and the support Groups continues to grow.
They also indicated that the self-imposed shops and restaurants are often put in place by their own shops and restaurants.

Spain's budget deficit reduction opportunities are jeopardised by the failure to set up a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) made an opinion that Spain and Portugal have failed to implement sufficient measures to reduce the level of deficit to 3% of gross domestic product.
Estimates show that despite austerity measures Portugal's budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year.
The European Commission decided, however, not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the coming time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against both these countries is the growing Euro-scepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions for further sanctions would only increase.
Critics, it says, is not consistent in its decisions on uniform rules from the beginning of the agreement and then failing to enforce them in practice.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, President Jenss, said that Europe is losing credibility in this way, giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendations rather than binding.
Now the EC has been proposed and all Member States have approved the extension of the budget deficit by the end of this year to Portugal and by 2018.
The European Commission is promising to examine the progress made by both countries in the next few months while pointing out the need for both Spain and Portugal to be ready to implement additional austerity measures if the conditions are met.
The initial forecasts indicate that the targets set for Portugal could be achieved in the course of due time, and this budget deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that the government of this country must implement austerity measures this year, amounting to 0. 25% of GDP.
These measures should be included in the annual budget, with additional attention being paid to the control of the procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit is to be reduced to 4. 6% of GDP.
Moreover, over the next two years, consolidation measures should be 0. 5% of GDP.
In particular, it makes the fact that eight months for the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on the establishment of a government, and becoming more and more the opportunity for Spain to hold early parliamentary elections.
However, public opinion polls show that the political landscape in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party continues to be a party led by the current Prime Minister, Mr Mariano Rhodesia, who again won the elections by 33%.
For the most popularity of the economy, only the socialists, as long as the 'Podemos', 'Positive' and 'Ciudadanos', are concerned, the popularity of the economy is slightly reduced
The People's Party wants the involvement of socialists and "Ciudadanos" to be involved in the government, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft 2017 budget to the European Commission for approval.
As a result of the parliamentary elections, Mr Rafah Hernando, in the case of the government, will be a laughing stock of the European Union.
Pronunciation of the circus in Riga is critical.
Fifty years after the beaching of the beaches, activism showed that the number of waste was growing annually, and the number of bathing areas for mostly bathing sites here.
The most polluted bathing sites are directly in Riga.
At the end of the day, it will be clear that bathing water is a mess for the whole day, but it is very difficult for ordinary visitors.
In addition, the waste left in the land area may be fed into the water, thus causing a great deal of damage to its quality.
In the case of the Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzeme, the purview is critical.
This communication has been distributed to the European Parliament this week.
For the fifth year on the road along the road along the Gulf of Riga, the activists have concluded that the number of waste left in the population is a hundred per metre.
Unfortunately, this year, the assessment of the critical evaluation has occurred.
"We can see that this will be a year when the number of waste is in the hands of the beach to 100 metres," he said.
Latvia's President
This year, we have had to gather even the activism of the divisive marathon and the puzzle, which left the boat in the sea.
A rticle actor and organiser, Ulme deic, pollutant, pollutant, directly
"The main source is the plastics of the beachers, since more than half of the total waste is plastics, varying from bags, plastics which are already in the pipeline, they can no longer be identified
There are also bathing areas in Riga.
For example, in Daugavbe, almost 800 metres on average, which is critical.
The organisers of campaign will also make it clear that they are smoking at the same time as smoke and not everywhere in the warning or ban.
"The Middle East, together with Daugasily, Daugasily, yesterday, and the elderly - unfortunately get big and far more than desired," said Mr Schulz.
The cleaning of the site in Riga takes place on a daily basis, even twice as a result of the summer, in order to prevent the use of the site.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue.
"Those who are in charge of alcohol abuse drinks and are doing all things they don't want," said High Representative.
The High Representative is therefore invited to report on the presence of the polluters to the police.
It may be called the police, security, state of play and the fight against terrorism.
Perhaps there may be some new warnings but, as I said, it is unlikely that the situation will be radically changed.
"All right," he said.
In the meantime, the measurements of water quality have been carried out for the fourth time in the health check, which may be banned for official bathing sites.
This year, the water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The situation is now that, in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has been good for all the 56 bathing waters.
"The last time we will take an analysis of the results of the August last year," he said.
In the light of the heavy rainfall on terrestrial waste, the waste left in the water.
This, in turn, may affect the quality of the environment.
Rotation in Russia is ongoing - Putin's administration change.
Awis of himself
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that "Sergei Ivanov," he said, would have liked to have been in the hands of the President of the European Parliament.
When announcing the changes, Putin's TV cameras have been in front of us for a number of years: "
I am pleased with the way you carry out your duties.
I am well aware of our agreement not to use our agreement in this area for more than four years.
That is why I am aware of your desire to change the scope of the action.
And I hope you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the management of the President's administration is very important and made the Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that Russia's next month elections are expected to be held in Russia, it is rumoured that this step involves the fight for power in Russia's political elites.
Ivanov has also been mentioned as a possible substitute for Putin, and the claim that he himself wished to take on the role of the President of the President for nature protection and transport.
As Lsm.lv show the KGs and the Federal Security Officer.
Ivanov has been a sine qua and close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He was launched in 1975 in his own brand with Putin.
At the same time, the Ivanov has become a Vice-President of the Commission.
In the case of the first Russian President, Mr Boris Yeltsin was appointed as Secretary of State for Security Council.
The following spoke:
On the other hand, the European Parliament, he said, was not a member of the Russian defense minister, but he was not in charge of the Russian defence industry.
Now, after the President's office, Ivanov, Ivanov will also maintain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President of the President of the Government will also work.
The images come from the family council.
The head of the President's administration, Mr Vaino himself, said the Ivanov.
We are familiar with Mr Antonu Eduardovic.
Even from the time you worked in the government.
And for nearly five years, we are in touch with virtually every day.
"That is why I am convinced that, after all professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The picture comes from the families of the Soviet parties.
His grandfather Karls in the Communist Party of Estonia, including a decade until 1988, was its first Secretary.
The "Meduza" poll with a reference to the book 'Hellenic' of 'Estonia's self-determination and independence' writes that the Kuznette was asking Moscow to give an authorisation against the demonstrators.
However, he was withheld and soon lost office.
Shortly afterwards, it has moved to Moscow.
Antonwill Vaino is absent from Moscow's International Relations with Moscow.
However, he has gone from the diplomatic service to the President of the Bureau.
It has been reported that the disdaunted Russian-county Russia has been shaken by a number of high-level officials and even arrests, including the Governor and federal representatives.
As the polls show, President Vladimir Putin is putting an end to the elite.
One of the main features - and more and more - are the involvement of the bodies involved.
The Cold War is also losing the Olympic Games in the first fight.
This was the fight in the first round, and the Latvian Judo Day is in the first place in the Olympic Games.
In the case of the Latvian Television, the Basque Television Front Basketball Basketball Basketball Basketball Trends said.
He also found that the FSB had been in the fight against terrorism.
Significantly, in order to get the Olympic Labelling List, New Vehicle Bodies I had to come from other weight than the 100 kilogrammes.
The Azerbaijani fighting was 25 kilograms.
It has been reported that Jevgenijs Borodavich has been in the Chamber in the fight against the centre-right of the press to 100 Kg.
Latvia's Janša ready to become a member of the European Union
The carcasses will be disappear.
A glance by the juice Bovgewsium was introduced.
Yes, he was a more prevalent opponent, but an ambitious one is at times able to come.
He did not.
In an unusual New Deal it was even more complex, because experience is less and oppressive.
The outcome is a similar one, with a minute's silence in memory of Mr Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, the Latvian gentleman is most likely to lack the ambition.
In the light of the fact that, in the wake of the failure of the federal, Kirsons, Djukanovs, Latvia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Poland.
Jackevich who advise Kazakhstan's junior junior, and Vsevolina Zochers do not see any.
But if not, it will not be.
It is a federal prerogative.
As a result, the promise of the President of Latvia, the president of the Latvian Federation, the President of Latvia in Rio de Janeiro.
A flight from reality.
In the evening, the House will also vote on a resolution on this topic.
Involvement in the "death" category
The Latvian durability was also a sine qua non, but no more than four points.
The long-standing game has been pushed hard.
Nobody wanted to die - this enthusiastically crystal over the cold corn over the cold.
The adulterated wind stories caused further complications.
At the start of the beginning, it seems that this could be ours - which is more comprehensive - ally.
But not.
The Latvian shower was enough.
Certificates for Samoilova and the waiting time for him.
It was a testament to Canada, at the end of the first session and at the beginning of the third, since the load was not a joke.
The motto at that time could have been watered down because the work was little, but when it was paid for honesty.
Brammal Samoilovs with the winner of the Royal Naoilovs wrote in two seasons with 16: 15.
But there was also a loss of 0: 2, because the second seed deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind.
The third has already been replaced by the Evang.
The European Parliament has been unveiled: the second game, the second game, often lived too close to the network and to Samoilovreach.
If there were any alien to Samoilovs.
The Kreible was wrong, too enough symbolically, that the bumbless blockade of the last bomb was directly he.
The team.
This time, there is also a lack of progress in the third, two of which have been left out of the corner.
The two were beside the line.
Also, the controversial episodes of the European Parliament in favour of opponents of the directive will also be discussed.
If the first two games were to be filled with a server, then it was very productive.
Everything together pulled to the tablet.
It is now a calm analysis of failure.
It may have been a matter for many neighbouring countries to live alongside the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours.
Maybe a little self-confidence came from the seven sides.
Maybe there should not have been to play, but to come here more quickly and to come here.
Perhaps there was a slippery form with a virus of the sporadic form.
So far more than the answer.
Our bar is over.
The accusation is over.
What next?
Some of the World Cup turns - and also the Jurmala "Masters" - have yet to come.
Smoking in the lives of Samoilova has never been friends and will not be, because there are too many different personalities.
But it is not necessary.
When the dream of the Olympic medallists is collapsed, the idea is also of a divorce, because the fault will be sought not only in the face but also the partner.
It is not difficult, but it is much more difficult in Latvia.
The two brothers of the bishops game, but Jānis Toma, has already tried and is also of the same opinion, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to begin to win the world.
The Edspirit Toys, Alexander SoloveI, will go back to the Edspirit Toulouse, but this will not be a better option than it had at the World Cup.
They were not the smallest for them this time.
And all.
It is, of course, also taking into account the fact that the voLower voLower is becoming more popular, more cross-border over and above two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
It is not.

The case of the Art icle Juri
An exhibition of the Riga Vice Chair of the Riga City Council said that a museum's address could not be the case in the future, but a museum's seat would be more than one of the playgrounds.
Muzeja Director, Mimi Mollica, admitted that the address would lead to a good bureaucratic burden, but in general, this idea was broadly welcomed and agreed by the municipalities.
The Riga City Council has put a strain on this idea in 1936 by the creation of the Burwd Szeta Monument.
At the same time, a Director museum was one of the initiators of the monument.
That way, it might be a pure logic.

"In spite of the fact that political will to launch the EF culture renovation of the EF, we are waiting for a decision for months to come, with real action from officials in the Ministry of Finance.
Last December we told us that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission that accept the decision to accept that Brussels is not taking any decision.
We are now seeing that there is another discussion at the moment, yet we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and concluded within the deadlines," Burov said.
It has already been reported that more than one year ago, in March 2015, the Castle Castle of VEF Castle Coastal Castle had been renovated before a year ago.
Although the year has passed, renovation was still not started and collective work continued in unsuitable conditions.
The Riga City Council's website of the VEF culture, the renowned Palace of VEF, is divided into seemingly independent bodies, where everyone will ensure different enforcement functions.
First of all, the VEF culture and the good installation of the surrounding area.
It provides for the surroundings of the neighbourhood and civil engineering and rebuilding the building blocks.
Second: improving the supply of cultural Palace in the EWF.
It plans to improve the quality of life of the building, walls and cut the look-alike enclosures of the building, and in order to put an end to the building of the building.
Third - improving the collective working conditions of amateur plants, which include plans to improve workshops, heating and ventilation systems.

This shows that the lenses of the lenses are not simply the yellow of the yellow but the yellow face of racism.
Snapchat is not the sole company that has been trapped in these crops.
American culture is also involved in the endless fight for diversity and inclusion, from business premises to Holivudins and devices, which we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's big young audience, which represents different race, unlike older people, is more sensitive to such cases.

On the one hand, the business leader of the business leader has been the subject of the debate and recommended that others do so.
On the other hand, in the case of the "Medium" and "telephony," she said she said she wanted "to have the best possible use of violence" in the EU.
He was criticised by the company for the management of the company composed mainly of white men and then concluded by the #Deletechatar.
"This means that there are no racial diversity in the company, so that such decisions are made in a company with a few other racial representatives, but they do not take office so that they can express their views," he said.
They are also shared by others, while Snapchat has not replied to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees to the different race, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his staff, but the representative revealed that the company has a staff of staff who will be concentrating on a company, which is not widely represented and will facilitate the inclusion of racial minorities.
However, I am not going to update my own Snapchat's account, adding: 'Interewonder whether they really need more users like us to realise that this is not right'.

In March 1933, the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, took the floor in a corner of the House.
It has been a shame for President Brown's hedges such as the clash of the pageant pair of closeness, or fuagry and Merilsendants.

From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding for 30 percent, which means that several thousand people will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.

Great Britain has to keep the Olympic spirit and broaden Heathrow.
Headquarters will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also in the whole country.
This, in my opinion, makes Headings very attractive, like in 2012, in London, where we put an enormous effort so that all of the country's regions would benefit from the Olympic Games.
A disagreement has been achieved with a huge number of Olympic Games.
And we will be doing this again by providing local people with business opportunities and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
The local communities alone will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment at Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who believe that this challenge is too high and that the extension of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain never will be prepared to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it will be a global failure.
The questionnaire was wrong for 2012 and also in the case of Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heat and the Heathrow so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits all society and not separately.
Enlargement is the opportunity to generate up up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth and the creation of the ground, creating both employment and experience at this airport.
An excellent team work in Heathrow, which has created a £11 billion investment programme in the time and budget for the period from 5 to 5 years, starting with a terminal of three more intensively used in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed through private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that there will also be Headings.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and broaden Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Nitone is a member of the board of Heathrow, a former member of the Economic Minister for Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, it is a woman on a boy to try to get suicide.
On the other hand, there was a great deal.

The accident took place on Thursday after the midnight on A1.
The police report states that desperately wish to commit suicide, a woman was acquainted with the darkness of the road to a dark of the road.
It is incomprehensible that the victims, the victims, the 49 years old, have been driven by several cars, including a heavy car.
She died at the scene.
A number of the drivers involved have already given testimony, but others have not yet been clarified, says the report.
The case is also open to criminal investigations, which is a logical step in this case, an opportunity for the benefit of a lawyer, Gilles de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstellers said: "This is clear from the public."
Two similar cases, which have occurred during the last 5 years, show that one of the drivers will not be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrian had left the road to a great deal, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that night on the road to a pedestrian.
Last year, a policeman was justified in the killing of a man in August 2014, with a man who left the A1 road near the A1 road near the A1 path.
The European Court of Justice found that the 22 years old had been drunk and subsequently went to sleep.
The Court concluded that the policeman was on the road to an accident.
Anyone who has the information on the accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone or 021.44 44 44 44.
